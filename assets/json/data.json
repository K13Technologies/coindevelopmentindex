Forked blocks are disregarded.\n\nMore to come stay tuned\n",

It's optional for witnesses, seed nodes and other users.\r\n\r\n**NOTE: It's REQUIRED to run a NTP daemon on the same server which will mitigate several issues.**\r\n\r\n## New features and changes\r\n* Added a `max-ops-per-account` option to `account_history` plugin, when set, only at most that number of history entries per account will be kept in memory. Set it to `0` to store no history. Set it to a big number to keep all history. If `partial-operations` option is set to `true` at the same time, old `operation_history_object` data (1.11.x) will be removed from memory as well, which will save a lot of RAM. Changing of these parameters need a replay to take effect.\r\n\r\n  This is recommended for public API service providers. Set these options in `config.ini`, then restart `witness_node` with `--replay-blockchain`:\r\n  ```\r\n  max-ops-per-account = 1000\r\n  partial-operations = true\r\n  ```\r\n* Added a `removed_ops` field to `account_statistics_object` to track number of entries removed; behavior of `total_ops` field didn't change.\r\n* Fixed Windows build.\r\n\r\n## Known issues\r\n* `get_relative_account_history` command / API in `cli_wallet` may return incorrect data when `limit` is greater than `100` and `start` is too big. (see #298)\r\n* As of writing, the Windows binaries attached to this release are built without `readline` support, so `cli_wallet.exe` lack of some features, for example tab completion and Ctrl-D termination. \r\n\r\n## Other notes\r\n* Future GUI releases will be published under https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-ui/releases only.\r\n* SHA256 checksum of attached binary `BitShares-Core-2.0.170606-x64-cli-tools.zip` is `0a96598b1020daca5987558bfc998f3663c7e4188cdf0a1abac779253ac33635`\r\n",

                "description": "This release contains several security fixes, as well as new features that improve performance.\r\n\r\n* **All Ubuntu nodes are recommended to upgrade to this release.** Untested under other Operating Systems so far.\r\n* It's **REQUIRED** to run a NTP daemon on the same server which will mitigate several issues.\r\n\r\n## New features and changes\r\n* Added a `partial-operations` option to `account_history` plugin. RAM requirement is significantly reduced when this option is used with `track-account` option combined. Highly recommended for Witness nodes, seed nodes, Exchanges and other node operators which don't need to watch account history or only need to watch histories of a small set of accounts. (#289)\r\n  For Example, the OpenLedger.io exchange can use this config (for deposit processing, but not for API servers):\r\n  ```\r\n  track-account = \"1.2.96393\"\r\n  track-account = \"1.2.96397\"\r\n  partial-operations = true\r\n  ```\r\n* Added a `get_relative_account_history` command / API to CLI wallet. Very useful for accounts with large quantity of histories. (#277)\r\n* Added `get_block_header_batch` database API (#262)\r\n* Added `get_account_history_operations` node API for account_history plugin (#237)\r\n* Added new API sets: `asset_api` and `block_api` (#224, #225, #226)\r\n* Added `is_public_key_registered` database API and CLI command / API, added `derive_owner_keys_from_brain_key` CLI command / API (#235)\r\n* `get_full_accounts` API now returns force settlement orders, withdraw permissions and list of owned assets (#261, #232, #229)\r\n* `get_market_history` CLI command / API now returns the most recent data (#242)\r\n* When calling an API method, now it's able to specify the API-identifier by the name directly, rather than a number.(https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-fc/pull/2, more info in #223)\r\n* Clients now will be authenticated implicitly on the server side if a correct HTTP Authorization request header is present when connected. This means API's those require `login` now can be accessed via HTTP directly as well as WebSocket without an explicit `login` call. (#223, https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-fc/pull/1)\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n* Additional console log for already in use p2p port (#264)\r\n* Web socket now pushes less data by default. (#249)\r\n* Removed log of private keys in witness start (#236)\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n* Fixed an issue that may cause the network to stale when a witness is misbehaving (#17)\r\n* Fixed an issue that may cause double spending when a witness is misbehaving\r\n* Fixed an issue that causes seed nodes to stop responding to new connections\r\n* Fixed a crash caused by DNS issues when the node is starting (#18)\r\n* Fixed a crash when the node is starting (#274)\r\n* Fixed a crash in get_ticker and get_24_volume API (#250, #255)\r\n* Fixed a memory leak issue (#257)\r\n* Fixed `track-account` option of account history plugin (#259)\r\n* Fixed several issues found in `get_relative_account_history` node API (#280, #281)\r\n\r\n## Other changes\r\n* Updated default seed node list\r\n\r\n## Other notes\r\n* Future GUI releases will be published under https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-ui/releases only.\r\n",

This means in terms of the code-base we introduced all the changes between Bitcoin 0.9 and 0.11 into this version of Dogecoin Core.  \nWe therefore suggest to read the release notes of both [Bitcoin 0.10](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.10.0.md) and [Bitcoin 0.11](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.11.0/doc/release-notes.md). 1.10 is a recommended update for all users, and if you cannot update to 1.10 for whatever reason, you must update to 1.8.3 which is a critical security fix to 1.8.2. \n\n# Upgrading\n\nTo upgrade from any version below 1.10 you will need to re-index once, as the block database format has changed. If you run the Qt GUI client, it will prompt you to do so on the first start after the update. If you run a dogecoind daemon, you will need to start it with the parameter `-reindex` once after you updated. This process can take a few hours, depending on the performance of your machine.\n\nIMPORTANT: During reindex transactions will be \"replayed\" by the wallet as they're indexed, meaning that your balance will not necessarily be accurate until the end of the reindex process. Do not send transactions during reindex, as this may result in conflicted transactions once the reindex is complete.\n\n# Notable changes\n\nFor further explanation of these, see the above mentioned Bitcoin release notes.\n\n## Faster synchronization\n\nDogecoin Core 1.10 introduces headers-first and parallel block synchronization to greatly reduce the initial blockchain synchronization time.\n\n## Watch only address support\n\nIt is now possible to add public keys to your wallet that will be held in a \"watch only\" state. This means you will get information about incoming/outgoing transactions and resulting balance changes. Especially useful to keep track of your paper wallets.\n\n## Strict signature encoding (BIP66)\n\nThis release activates [BIP66](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0066.mediawiki) which enforces strict rules about how transaction signatures are encoded and therefore will introduce a new block version (3). These rules will only activate once a certain number of blocks are mined with this new version. NOTE: This is **not** a hard fork, as all existing wallets will accept version 3 blocks, although they'll fail to enforce the new requirements.\n\n## Block file pruning\n\nIt is possible to run a Dogecoin node without keeping the full blockchain on your disk. This is currently incompatible with having a wallet on that client due to the fact that some actions regarding a wallet require the full block data. The minimum amount of kept blocks has been changed from Bitcoin to reflect our shorter block times.  \n\n## General comments\n\nPlease backup your wallet regularly and especially before performing this upgrade. Do not copy your wallet.dat while Dogecoin Core is open. Instead you should either use the backup feature you find in the \"File\" menu or shut down Dogecoin Core completely before you make a copy of your wallet.dat.  \n",

Dogecoin Core 1.8.1 also adds in support for printing\npaper wallets, and disables connections to pre-1.8 clients. This is a RECOMMENDED\nupgrade due to the large number of bug fixes, but is not a required one.\n\nPaper wallet support has been developed by AndyMeows (IRC username), and \ncan be accessed via the \"File\" menu. It's intended for two purposes; to generate\nsmall value paper wallets to hand out, and more permanent deposit paper wallets\nfor keeping balances offline.\n\nIMPORTANT: If you are producing offline paper wallets, you should do so on a\ncomputer that's disconnected from the Internet. While the wallet generator\ndoes not save the keys it generates, this ensures there is no risk of a virus\nor similar capturing the key from memory or interfering with its generation.\n\n## Dogecoin Core Release Notes\n- Translation improvements and corrections\n- Disable Transifex based translation process (not used by Dogecoin Core)\n- Add checkpoints around AuxPoW switchover block (371,337)\n- Disable connections from pre-1.8 Dogecoin Core clients\n- Use HTTPS with dogechain.info\n- Remove unreachable code introduced with AuxPoW support\n- \"blocknotify\" option now supports %i as a format parameter, which is replaced by block height\n- New option \"maxoutconnections\" to set the maximum number of outbound peer connections. Defaults to 8, minimum is 2, maximum is whatever \"maxconnections\" is set to (default 125).\n\n## Bitcoin Core Release Notes\n\nFull release notes for Bitcoin Core 0.9.3 are available from\nhttps://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.9.3 , but highlights are included\nbelow:\n- Better orphan transaction handling\n- Add -maxorphantx=<n> and -maxorphanblocks=<n> options for control over the maximum orphan transactions and blocks\n- key.cpp: fail with a friendlier message on missing ssl EC support\n- Upgrade OpenSSL to 1.0.1i (see https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140806.txt - just to be sure, no critical issues for Bitcoin Core)\n\n## Known Issues\n\nThere is a known issue with quantities in JSON used by the RPC interface (https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues/134).\nThis stems from the use of a floating point precision number to hold fixed precision data.\nCurrently looking at solutions, which primarily either involve JSON which is not compliant\nto the specification, or making the RPC layer slightly incompatible with the conventional\nBitcoin API.\n\nThis only affects values significantly below 1 Doge, however merchants may wish to round to\nthe nearest Doge on all transactions for now.\n\n## Credits\n\nListed in strictly alphabetical order, using name listed in Github.

                "description": "The Go Ethereum team is proud to announce the next release family of Geth, the first incarnation of which focuses on laying the groundwork for the upcoming Metropolis hard forks (Byzantium and Constantinople) and consists of [125+ code contributions](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/milestone/47?closed=1) to various parts of the project.\r\n\r\n## Byzantium fork\r\n\r\nThe current incarnation of Geth contains all the Byzantium EIPs implemented and also features the fork block number **1,700,000** for the Ropsten testnet transition. The block numbers for Rinkeby and the main Ethereum network will be finalized when Ropsten is deemed stable.\r\n\r\nYou can find details about individual protocol updates at the following locations:\r\n\r\n* **[EIP 98](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/98)**: Removal of intermediate state roots from receipts ([#14750](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14750)).\r\n* Expanded by **[EIP 658](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/658)**: Embedding transaction return data in receipts ([#15014](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15014)).\r\n* **[EIP 100](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/100)**: Change difficulty adjustment to target mean block time including uncles ([#14733](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14733)).\r\n* **[EIP 198](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/198)**, **[EIP 212 (197)](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/212)** and **[EIP 213 (196)](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/213)**: Precompiled contracts for modular exponentiation; elliptic curve addition, scalar multiplication and pairing ([#14959](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14959), [#14993](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14993)).\r\n* **[EIP 214 (116)](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/214)**: Expanding the EVM with static contract calls ([#14978](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14978)).\r\n* **[EIP 211](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/211)**: Expanding the EVM with dynamically sized return data ([#14981](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14981)).\r\n* **[EIP 206 (140)](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/206)**: Expanding the EVM with cheap state revertals ([#14983](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14983)).\r\n* **[EIP 649](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/669)**: Delaying the difficulty bomb and reducing the block reward ([#15028](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15028)).\r\n* **[EIP 684](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/684)**: Preventing overwriting contracts (Byzantium prep) ([#15039](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15039)).\r\n\r\n## Performance optimizations\r\n\r\nThe 1.7 release series of Geth is aimed to focus primarily on performance improvements (beside the Byzantium hard fork). The first release of the family already packs a heavy punch with two database schema modifications resulting in significant optimizations:\r\n\r\n* Transaction and receipt storage was completely reworked, cutting the data storage requirements of a fast synced node in half, from 26.3GB to 14.9GB at the time of the implementation ([#14801](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14801)).\r\n* EVM log storage and indexing was completely reworked, cutting the filtering time of the entire chain for contract events by 2-3 orders of magnitude, from minutes to under a second ([#14522](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14522), [#14631](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14631)).\r\n\r\nSome work-in-progress updates that will land in the next releases are:\r\n\r\n* Upgrading the base peer-to-peer protocol used by all Ethereum sub-protocols, cutting the bandwidth needed for a fast sync from 33.6GB to 13.5GB ([#15106](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15106)). This upgrade will improve the general bandwidth requirement of the network as well as light clients too.\r\n* Introducing a more sophisticated memory caching for state tries, reducing disk IO by a couple orders of magnitude. Exact number are pending a final implementation ([#14952](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14952)).\r\n\r\n## Trezor wallets\r\n\r\nAbout this time last year we've introduced support for the Ledger hardware wallet. Due to popular demand, we've now expanded on our hardware wallet offering by also rolling out support for the Trezor ([#14885](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14885)).\r\n\r\nOpposed to the Ledger however, the Trezor is a bit more complicated as it requires a PIN-unlock sent from the communicating machine instead of directly input by the user. As such, when a user plugs in a Trezor, Geth will print:\r\n\r\n`New wallet appeared, failed to open url=trezor://0003:0007:00 err=\"trezor: pin needed\"`\r\n\r\nThe Geth console can be used to unlock the Trezor by invoking `personal.openWallet(url)`, which will request the user to enter the shuffled PIN code and send that over to the Trezor for verification:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> personal.openWallet(\"trezor://0003:0007:00\")\r\n\r\nLook at the device for number positions\r\n\r\n7 | 8 | 9\r\n--+---+--\r\n4 | 5 | 6\r\n--+---+--\r\n1 | 2 | 3\r\n\r\nPlease enter current PIN:\r\n\r\nINFO [08-10|11:58:06] New wallet appeared url=trezor://0003:0007:00 status=\"Trezor v1.5.0 'Hi' online\"\r\n```\r\nFor details on how to interact with the Trezor from the JSON-RPC APIs, please consult the [PR description](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14885).\r\n\r\n## Transaction journal\r\n\r\nIn the 1.6.x release family of Geth we've introduced a new transaction pool to avoid propagation issues due to minimum gas-price requirements. This new pool accepted all transactions irrelevant of pricing, and always kept the best paying 4K of them, discarding the cheaper ones.\r\n\r\nThe new pool features a special exemption mechanism for local accounts so that a user's own transactions are always prioritized over remote ones, even if they are under-priced compared to everyone else's. This ensures that cheap transactions don't get flushed out of the network during heavy usage (e.g. ICO) as long as the originating node remains online.\r\n\r\nGeth 1.7.0 takes this protective measure a step forward by journaling all locally created transactions to disk, and loading them back up on a node restart. This ensures that even if the originating node goes offline, cheap transactions still have a chance to be included when the node comes back ([#14784](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14784)).\r\n\r\nThe transaction journal can be an enormous help for node operators during software upgrades by not having to worry about local transactions going missing. Furthermore, the journal also acts as a resiliency mechanism against node crashes, ensuring that no transaction data is lost.\r\n\r\n## Rinkeby updates\r\n\r\nThere have been a lot of subtle tunings made to Puppeth and Rinkeby over the course of this release, such as better ethstats logging to detect malicious reporters and IP address blacklisting to deny access for them.\r\n\r\nThe Rinkeby testnet also proved vital in finding and and fixing a transaction pool event race that caused a lot of headache around lost transactions and/or duplicate nonce assignments. All such known errors have now been fixed ([#15085](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15085)).\r\n\r\nLastly we're extremely happy to announce that [Infura became an active player](https://blog.infura.io/infuras-signer-and-bootnode-on-rinkeby-440de6f70961) in the Rinkeby test network by aiding the community both with their own bootnode as well as running an authorized signer node. This should make the Rinkeby network even more robust and resilient.\r\n\r\n## Closing remarks\r\n\r\nGeth 1.7.0 contains a lot of bug fixes and we consider it our best release until now, however we urge everyone to take care with the upgrade and monitor it closely afterwards as it does contain non-trivial database upgrades.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we'd like to emphasize that **the upgraded database cannot be used by previous versions of Geth**. Our recommendation for production users it to sync from scratch with Geth 1.7.0, and leave the old database backed up until you confirm that the new release works correctly for all your use cases.\r\n\r\nFor a full rundown of the changes please consult the [Geth 1.7.0 release milestone](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pulls?page=1&amp;q=is%3Apr+milestone%3A1.7.0+is%3Aclosed).\r\n\r\n**As always, binaries and mobile libraries are available on our [download page](https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/).**",

                "description": "Geth 1.6.1 is mostly a bugfix release adding various polishes throughout the codebase.\r\n\r\nHighlights of the release are the capability to iterate over a contract's storage entries via the RPC; transitioning [Whisper to protocol v5](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Whisper) along with bundled diagnostics tools; and shorthand connectivity to the Rinkeby test network.\r\n\r\nFor a detailed rundown, please consult the [1.6.1 milestone](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/milestone/48?closed=1).\r\n\r\n### New features:\r\n\r\n \r\n * `debug_storageRangeAt` RPC supports iterating over contract storage entries (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14350).\r\n * Switch Whisper to protocol v5 (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14387), ship diagnostic tool (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14414).\r\n * Add `--rinkeby` flag to quickly connect to the Rinkeby testnet (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14418).\r\n * Support disabling USB hardware wallet lookups (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14357).\r\n * GitHub faucet bot protection (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14339) and funding tiers (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14402).\r\n * Add explicit SSH server key management for `puppeth` (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14398).\r\n * `geth init` and `geth removedb` operate on both full and light chains (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14412).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes and annoyances:\r\n\r\n * Forbid leading zeroes in RPC block numbers (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/13886).\r\n * Friendly error if the user tries to reinit its chain with an incompatible genesis (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14358).\r\n * Return `[]` instead of `null` when listing accounts but none can be found (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14374).\r\n * When generating bootnode keys, print and exit, don't start up node (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14372).\r\n * Make network IDs uniform uint64 everywhere (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14377).\r\n * Fix data race in during native dapp node restarts (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14379).\r\n * Support setting flags after sub-commands too (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14388, https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14413).\r\n * Fix `clique` miner ugly error log when starting a new network (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14411).\r\n\r\n**Binaries and mobile libraries are available on our [download page](https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/).**",

The major release was due to the September 15th hard fork, which in turn increased the minimum ring signature size to 5 across the network, banned duplicate ring members in a ring signature, and enforced the use of ringCT for all transaction outputs. This release of the software presents a number of major improvements to Monero, as well as a large set of bug fixes.\r\n\r\n[**The GUI release notes and downloads can be found on the release page here.**](https://github.com/monero-project/monero-core/releases/tag/v0.11.1.0)\r\n\r\nSome highlights of this point release are:\r\n\r\n- fixed an occasional sync failure that occurred when a transaction was already in the mempool\r\n- added an underflow check on low block heights\r\n- added a guard against a mined block not finding all the transactions in the mempool\r\n- fixed the transaction size estimator for transactions with a large number of inputs\r\n- fixed an LMDB issue on 32-bit systems\r\n- the get_tx_backlog RPC call was unrestricted\r\n- threads now guard against exceptions during transaction verification\r\n- fixed a crash that could occur when checking pre-validated transactions\r\n- various other bug fixes and improvements\r\n\r\nSome highlights of the major release this is a part of are:\r\n\r\n- major synchronisation speed-up from reducing bandwidth used\r\n- massively improved the blockchain import function\r\n- changed terminology from \"mixin\" to \"ring size\"\r\n- add a --fluffy-blocks option to relay blocks as fluffy blocks if possible\r\n- allow for password verification without loading the subsequently unencrypted wallet into RAM\r\n- reduced privacy leak risks when using untrusted remote nodes\r\n- added an Esperanto wordlist for mnemonic seed choices\r\n- decreased memory demands for the getblocks RPC call\r\n- added a \"fee\" command to display fee information\r\n- transfer CLI command warns if there's a tx backlog for selected fee\r\n- add average seconds per block in bc\\_dyn\\_stats\r\n- added an on\\_get\\_alt\\_blocks\\_hashes RPC call \r\n- added an Italian translation for the CLI\r\n- return the per-tx amount in the transfer\\_split RPC call\r\n- switched to readline for the CLI\r\n- automatically switch to SAFE db-sync-mode once daemon catches up to network\r\n- added a histogram to poolstats\r\n- major speed-up for poolstats and coinbase\\_tx\\_sum\r\n- enable support for macOS smart mining\r\n- added the ability to build a Snap package\r\n- added a Vulnerability Response Process, with bug bounties available via [a dedicated HackerOne portal](https://hackerone.com/monero)\r\n- added support for payment proving via key derivation instead of tx key reveal\r\n- changed output selection for ring signatures to heavily weight newer outputs\r\n- added a sweep\\_below function to sweep small amounts\r\n- moved the mempool to a database on disk instead of keeping it all in memory\r\n- fully enable iOS and Android full node support\r\n- enabled support for ppc64le architectures\r\n- added the ability to create and open wallets via RPC\r\n- added ability to relay transactions manually after creating them\r\n- better AC / battery power detection for Linux smart mining\r\n- getblocktemplate now indicates the expected total reward\r\n- as always, loads of bug fixes and performance improvements\r\n\r\n# Contributors for this Release\r\n\r\nThis release was the direct result of 39 people who worked, largely unpaid and altruistically, to put out 583 commits containing 60 350 new lines of code.

This release of the software presents a number of major improvements to Monero, as well as a large set of bug fixes.\r\n\r\n[**The GUI release notes and downloads can be found on the release page here.**](https://github.com/monero-project/monero-core/releases/tag/v0.11.0.0)\r\n\r\nSome highlights of this release are:\r\n\r\n- major synchronisation speed-up from reducing bandwidth used\r\n- massively improved the blockchain import function\r\n- changed terminology from \"mixin\" to \"ring size\"\r\n- add a --fluffy-blocks option to relay blocks as fluffy blocks if possible\r\n- allow for password verification without loading the subsequently unencrypted wallet into RAM\r\n- reduced privacy leak risks when using untrusted remote nodes\r\n- added an Esperanto wordlist for mnemonic seed choices\r\n- decreased memory demands for the getblocks RPC call\r\n- added a \"fee\" command to display fee information\r\n- transfer CLI command warns if there's a tx backlog for selected fee\r\n- add average seconds per block in bc\\_dyn\\_stats\r\n- added an on\\_get\\_alt\\_blocks\\_hashes RPC call \r\n- added an Italian translation for the CLI\r\n- return the per-tx amount in the transfer\\_split RPC call\r\n- switched to readline for the CLI\r\n- automatically switch to SAFE db-sync-mode once daemon catches up to network\r\n- added a histogram to poolstats\r\n- major speed-up for poolstats and coinbase\\_tx\\_sum\r\n- enable support for macOS smart mining\r\n- added the ability to build a Snap package\r\n- added a Vulnerability Response Process, with bug bounties available via [a dedicated HackerOne portal](https://hackerone.com/monero)\r\n- added support for payment proving via key derivation instead of tx key reveal\r\n- changed output selection for ring signatures to heavily weight newer outputs\r\n- added a sweep\\_below function to sweep small amounts\r\n- moved the mempool to a database on disk instead of keeping it all in memory\r\n- fully enable iOS and Android full node support\r\n- enabled support for ppc64le architectures\r\n- added the ability to create and open wallets via RPC\r\n- added ability to relay transactions manually after creating them\r\n- better AC / battery power detection for Linux smart mining\r\n- getblocktemplate now indicates the expected total reward\r\n- as always, loads of bug fixes and performance improvements\r\n\r\n# Contributors for this Release\r\n\r\nThis release was the direct result of 39 people who worked, largely unpaid and altruistically, to put out 557 commits containing 60 254 new lines of code.

                "description": "# Overview\n\nThis is the next major release of Monero. It adds an initial release of RingCT, which is already live on testnet. The RingCT whitepaper [can be found here](https://lab.getmonero.org/pubs/MRL-0005.pdf). Note that the v4 hard fork has been moved to the beginning of January, 2017, although the v5 hard fork remains set at September, 2017. This is to enable early availability of RingCT transactions on the Monero network, although they will not be enforced as the only possible transaction type until the v5 hard fork.\n\nOne of the largest pieces of work were the BlockchainDB performance improvements. This was largely done by warptangent, an early Monero contributor who passed away in March, 2016. His work was completed by Howard \"hyc\" Chu, and we have named this release after him. We are deeply grateful for all the effort he put in to making Monero what it is today.\n\nSome highlights of this release are:\n- major performance improvements, especially on spinning disks\n- major space saving gains for the blockchain, despite the performance improvements\n- renamed binaries to follow a more logical, consistent convention\n- RingCT...obviously:)\n- added libunwind support for better crash reporting\n- added a key image export and import function for full watch-only wallet functionality\n- added support for ARMv8 processors\n- added a do_not_relay flag for transactions sent to the daemon\n- added a sweep_all command and RPC call for the wallet\n- significant fixes and improvements to threading\n- add a get_transfers RPC call\n- added transfer tracking to the wallet (lost forever if the wallet cache is deleted)\n- added a filter_by_height option to get_transfers\n- added a --max-concurrency flag for the wallet\n- major improvements to ARM performance, especially on newer 64-bit chips\n- huge overhaul of cmake and the readme\n- added a wallet API for the GUI\n- added a fee multiplier and reduced fees\n- made monero-wallet-cli more robust when handling corrupt caches\n- prompt twice for a wallet password to avoid password issues\n- improved daemon 'status' details, including time to the next fork\n- more bug fixes than you can shake a stick at\n- temporary patch (via a predefined user-agent) for the CSRF attack against monero-wallet-cli's RPC API, as disclosed by Henry Hoggard\n\n# Updating: Blockchain Conversion\n\nDue to the space savings and performance gains it is again highly recommended that you delete the contents of your Monero working directory and sync from scratch. This directory can be found in ~/.bitmonero on Linux and OS X, and on Windows in \\Users\\username\\AppData\\Roaming\\bitmonero or \\ProgramData\\bitmonero.\n\nAlternatively, you can use `blockchain_export` from your previous install to export your current blockchain, then delete the lmdb folder in your working directory, and finally use `monero-blockchain-import` from 0.10.0 to reimport it.\n\n# Contributors for this Release\n\nThis release was the direct result of 28 people who worked, largely unpaid and altruistically, to put out 725 commits containing 15 332 new lines of code.

                "description": "This is a minor release that introduces a number of long-awaited features.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent features are remote file repair and wallet lookahead. Remote file repair allows Sia to automatically repair your files even after the original file data has been deleted from your machine. It works by downloading data from hosts, expanding it to the desired redundancy, and reuploading the redundant pieces to other hosts. This is a crucial feature for Sia because hosts that go offline or fail to meet quality requirements must be replaced. Note that in order for remote file repair to work, the file must report at least 1x redundancy.\r\n\r\nWallet lookahead means that the wallet will pre-generate the next *n* addresses for its seed, and watch the blockchain for them. (Remember, each address corresponds to a particular seed index.) For example, even if the user has only created 5 addresses from their seed, the wallet may internally be keeping track of the next 100 addresses. This functionality is mainly useful for people who use the same seed on multiple computers: before this fix, their wallet balance could be reported incorrectly, which caused some (understandable) anxiety.\r\n\r\nv1.3.0 also contains a number of additions to our API:\r\n\r\n- A `/wallet/changepassword` route, allowing users to change their wallet password\r\n- Upgraded `/wallet/sendsiacoins` to allow sending one output to multiple recipients (primarily useful for exchanges)\r\n- New `/tpool` endpoints for getting raw transaction data and transaction fee estimations\r\n- A `/host/estimatescore` endpoint for estimating your host's score, as seen by renters\r\n\r\nWe have also switched our gateway multiplexer from muxado to smux, which should improve stability and performance, and modified the gateway connection protocol to require fewer roundtrips while sending more actionable information.\r\n\r\nFinally, there were many internal bug fixes and optimizations, including transaction pool speed-ups, fixes for the renter stalling, and faster initial blockchain download. One of the fixes that I'll appreciate most is converting [this horrible-looking stack dump](https://github.com/NebulousLabs/Sia/issues/1745) to a simple and obvious \"out of disk space\" error.\r\n\r\nWe'd like to thank the huge number of contributors to this release. The quality of contributions has increased dramatically over the past few months, and it has made life a lot easier for the core devs. Please let me know if I missed anyone:\r\n\r\n- @rnabel worked with @johnathanhowell to implement remote file repair\r\n- @ChrisSchinnerl worked with @lukechampine to implement wallet lookahead, among other fixes\r\n- @GlenDC worked with @lukechampine to implement the muxado->smux transition and gateway protocol changes\r\n- @starius worked with @DavidVorick  to improve initial blockchain download speed\r\n- @elopio contributed packaging metadata for a Sia `snap` package\r\n- @aiorla made good use of a new JSON type in Go 1.8\r\n- @jnmclarty, @mharkus, @mtlynch, @petabytestorage, @rudibs, @S-anasol, and @skynode fixed up a bunch of documentation\r\n- @moimael added some flags to our release packaging to reduce the size of Sia binaries\r\n\r\nContributors have also helped keep the issue tracker under control by answering common questions and marking duplicates. This is part of an ongoing effort to rein in our issue tracker, which we plan to start pruning more aggressively in the coming weeks.",

The host's storage backend has been completely rewritten to improve performance and scalability. Admin privileges are also no longer required to be a host on Windows. The wallet has (finally!) moved to an on-disk database, meaning that it will unlock instantly after the database is synced to the blockchain. The wallet also now supports creating a new wallet from an existing seed, and \"sweeping\" the coins in an existing seed into another wallet. Finally, addressing a frequent need of new users, the wallet can be recreated with a new seed, meaning users no longer have to manually delete their `wallet` folder.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** Upgrading an existing host can take quite a long time. Please be patient. Similarly, the first time you unlock the new wallet, it will take a long time because it's initializing the database. This only needs to occur once.\r\n\r\nThis release marks a huge uptick in the number of contributors to Sia! :tada:\r\nThe following people contributed to v1.2.0:\r\n\r\n- @RNabel added bash completions for `siac` and a command that lists contract details. Power users will definitely appreciate this!\r\n- @GlenDC documented the gateway RPC protocol and started tackling numerous gateway issues. Look out for him in the next release!\r\n- @VoidingWarranties fixed a gateway bug. Couldn't stay away, huh? :)\r\n- @S-anasol cleaned up some host code.\r\n- @poiuty updated our Go dependency in the readme.\r\n\r\nIf you want to contribute to Sia, drop by our Slack.

The hostdb is smarter about scanning and ranking hosts, and you can see more in-depth output using the `siac hostdb -v` command.\r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Unfortunately, our upgrades to the Renter require a full rescan of the blockchain. As a result, if you are upgrading from an older version, `siad` may take a long time to load the first time you run it. On an HDD, this may take up to an hour. On an SSD it should take closer to 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nYou should be able to upgrade to v1.1.1 by running `siac update`.

The new wallet will regularly consolidate small outputs into one larger output.\n\nThanks to the new renter algorithm designed by @DavidVorick, we are seeing upload/download speeds that saturate most residential connections!

This gives developers a stable foundation to build upon.\n\nThe changes since v1.0.3 are negligible. The main function of this release is to split the LTS release line from the standard release line. This primarily affects the `siac update` command: if you run an LTS release, `siac update` will only update to later LTS releases, not standard releases. Conversely, if you run a standard release, `siac update` will never update to an LTS release, only standard releases.\n",

                "description": "This is a patch release that improves the stability and performance of the renter, in addition to many other minor bug fixes and miscellaneous tweaks. Our goal for this release was to make Sia viable for real-world use, even if only on a small scale. Only time will tell if we achieved that goal, but we are optimistic.\n\nMuch of the work that went into this release was aided by our new testing framework, the [Ant Farm](http://blog.sia.tech/2016/09/16/sia-antfarm-advanced-multi-node-testing/).\n\nOur next targeted release is v1.1.0, which will introduce some long-awaited features (such as instant wallet unlocking) as well as considerable performance upgrades for the renter and host.\n\nYou should be able to upgrade to v1.0.3 by running `siac update`. If something goes wrong, you can always update manually -- but please file a bug report or get in touch on our [Slack](http://slackin.sia.tech/).\n\nThanks as always to our contributors, users, and fans!\n",

                "description": "About Qtum and Mainnet Ignition\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nQtum is a decentralized blockchain project built on Bitcoin's UTXO model, with support for Ethereum Virtual Machine based smart contracts, and secured by a proof of stake consensus model. It achieves this through the revolutionary Account Abstraction Layer which allows the EVM to communicate with Qtum's Bitcoin-like UTXO blockchain. For more general information about Qtum as well as links to join our community, go to https://qtum.org\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Qtum Ignition Main Network. This is the main network where the tokens hold value and should be guarded very carefully. There will be a testnet setup soon for developers, in the meantime you can use `-regtest` mode for testing needs. We will announce details about the token swap from QTUM ERC20 coins to QTUM mainnet tokens soon, watch our [website](https://qtum.org) for details about that.  \r\n\r\nThe major features implemented in Qtum Ignition include:\r\n\r\n1. The Ethereum Virtual Machine, which allows for compatibility with most existing Solidity based smart contracts.\r\n2. The Smart Staking Protocol is complete, which is an optimized Proof of Stake implementation designed for a smart contract platform (however, smart contracts can not participate in staking yet).\r\n3. An early and basic smart contract GUI has been implemented that can be used for creating contracts, sending data and Qtum to them, and checking their status by executing them locally. This functionality is similar to Mist's UI right now, but it is still an early version. We will be working on this more to improve it. \r\n4. Regtest mode, which is ideal for developers who wish to create their own private blockchain. It is tuned specifically to make development easier. It will stake blocks automatically every 30 seconds, and can generate proof-of-work blocks instantly as needed.\r\n5. The Decentralized Governance Protocol is completely implemented and functional, which allows certain network parameters to be modified without a fork.\r\n\r\nFor more technical information for how to start developing with Qtum please read the [Guide](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/blob/master/doc/sparknet-guide.md) and also see this tutorial for deploying a simple [faucet smart contract](http://earlz.net/view/2017/06/30/2144/the-qtum-sparknet-faucet) (it hasn't yet been updated for Mainnet for obvious reasons, but all the instructions are the same and you can try them in regtest mode)\r\n\r\nNote: Qtum Core is considered beta software. We make no warranties or guarantees of its security or stability.\r\n\r\nUpdate History\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n* v1.1.2 - Optional update, but recommended if using QRC tokens\r\n    * Fixed a bug with token transactions where the transaction ID displayed was incorrect in the Qt wallet\r\n    * Allow adding 0 balance addresses as the token receiver in the Qt wallet\r\n* v1.1.1: When sending to contracts, the sender address is now the default change address to reduce confusion; fix -salvagewallet so it works with token transactions\r\n* v1.1.0: Add GUI support Qtum QRC tokens, allowing full management of tokens on the Qtum blockchain from the Qt wallet\r\n    * Sending to a contract no longer requires ABI data, allowing easy participation in simple crowdsale contracts\r\n* v1.0.4: Fix bug where certain circumstances when staking could cause the displayed balance to be inaccurate until completely redownloading the blockchain.\r\n* v1.0.3: Fix staker bug that reported false messages; slightly increases staking performance; optimize staker parameters; fix white send button in GUI\r\n* v1.0.2: Various UI fixes, minor gas overflow consensus fix, per-txout exploit fix, testnet mode setup and functioning\r\n* v1.0.1: Fixed network magic bytes and minimum version to ensure the main network does not conflict with the Skynet network\r\n* v1.0: Initial release\r\n\r\nReindex Required When Upgrading from v1.0.1\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhen you first start the Qtum 1.0.2 GUI wallet after using Qtum v1.0.1 it will prompt you that it must reindex the database. This is normal and is a result of switching our internal database format from per-transaction to per-txout. If you use `qtumd -daemon` it will silently fail to start. You need to use `qtumd -daemon -reindex` in this case. \r\n\r\nQtum Documentation and Usage Resources\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nBasic usage resources:\r\n\r\n* [Official Qtum Usage Guide](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/wiki/Qtum-Wallet-Tutorial)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum staking tutorial](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/qtum-staking-tutorial-using-qtum-qt)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum staking tutorial on Raspberry Pi](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/qtum-staking-tutorial-using-qtumd-on-a-raspberry-pi-3)\r\n* [Unofficial guide for keeping your wallet safe](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/encrypting-backing-up-and-restoring-your-qtum-wallet)\r\n* [Block explorer](https://explorer.qtum.org)\r\n* [Unofficial block explorer](https://qtumexplorer.io/)\r\n\r\nDevelopment resources:\r\n\r\n* [Deploying a custom token to Qtum](https://blog.qtum.org/qtum-custom-token-walkthrough-467d725fa27d)\r\n* [Early example faucet contract](http://earlz.net/view/2017/06/30/2144/the-qtum-sparknet-faucet)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum Hello World tutorial](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/quantum-qtum-blockchain-developer-tutorial-hello-world)\r\n\r\nGeneral Info about Qtum:\r\n\r\n* [Mainnet event AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/comments/6zs8t0/official_qtum_ama_thread_starts_at_10pm_beijing/)\r\n* [Qtum's PoS vs CASPER](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/comments/788oa5/qtums_pos_vs_casper_and_the_nothingatstake_problem/)\r\n* [Technical article explaining Qtum's PoS model in depth](http://earlz.net/view/2017/07/27/1904/the-missing-explanation-of-proof-of-stake-version)\r\n* [Unofficial What is Qtum article](https://storeofvalue.github.io/posts/what-is-qtum-without-the-bullshit/)\r\n\r\nQuickstart\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get started with Qtum is to simply download the binaries below. To give a brief breakdown of the different versions available: \r\n\r\n#### Windows\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.8-win64.zip](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.2/qtum-0.14.8-win64.zip) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using Windows.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.8-win64-setup-unsigned.exe](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.2/qtum-0.14.8-win64-setup-unsigned.exe) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using Windows.

If you have an older Windows computer and don't care about installing Qtum system-wide, \r\n* [qtum-0.14.8-win32-setup-unsigned.exe](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.2/qtum-0.14.8-win32-setup-unsigned.exe) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 machines using Windows. This includes an installer and will install Qtum system wide. If you have an older Windows computer and want to install Qtum then this is for you.\r\n\r\n#### OSX\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.8-osx64.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.2/qtum-0.14.8-osx64.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using OSX. If you use a modern Mac and want development tools, this is what you want; we do not support older 32bit or PowerPC based Macs.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.8-osx-unsigned.dmg](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.2/qtum-0.14.8-osx-unsigned.dmg) - A version of Qtum-Qt built for 64bit x86 machines using OSX in a .DMG installable format. If you use a modern Mac and aren't a developer, this is what you want; we do not support older 32bit or PowerPC based Macs.\r\n\r\n#### Linux\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.8-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.2/qtum-0.14.8-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 PC platforms running Linux. This is probably what you want for older computers running Linux\r\n* [qtum-0.14.8-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.2/qtum-0.14.8-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 PC platforms running Linux. This is probably what you want for any modern PC or server running Linux\r\n* [qtum-0.14.8-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.2/qtum-0.14.8-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz) - A version of qtumd and qtum-cli built for 32bit ARM platforms using Linux. This includes the Raspberry Pi and many of it's clones\r\n* [qtum-0.14.8-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.2/qtum-0.14.8-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of qtumd and qtum-cli built for 64bit ARM platforms using Linux\r\n\r\nBelow in the full list of binaries, there are also versions that include debug symbols. These are useful for developers, but will run slower and are significantly larger to download. \r\n\r\n#### Build Qtum Core\r\n\r\nIf you want to build it from source, it's recommended to follow the specific [\"build\" documentation](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/tree/testnet-2/doc) for your platform. But mostly it boils down to the following:\r\n\r\n1. Clone the qtum source code and cd into `qtum`\r\n\r\n        git clone --recursive https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum.git\r\n        cd qtum\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Build qtum-core:\r\n\r\n    Configure and build the headless qtum binaries as well as the GUI (if Qt is found).\r\n\r\n    You can disable the GUI build by passing `--without-gui` to configure.\r\n\r\n        ./autogen.sh\r\n        ./configure\r\n        make\r\n\r\n3.  It is recommended to build and run the unit tests to ensure everything is working correctly:\r\n\r\n        make check\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you encounter an error like:\r\n\r\n> make[2]: *** No rule to make target \u2018cpp-ethereum/utils/libscrypt/b64.c\u2019, needed by \u2018cpp-ethereum/utils/libscrypt/libbitcoinconsensus_la-b64.lo\u2019.  Stop.\r\n\r\nThen you did not checkout the cpp-ethereum submodule for Qtum. To do that, simply:\r\n\r\n    cd qtum\r\n    git submodule update --init --recursive\r\n\r\nValidate and Reproduce Binaries\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nQtum uses a tool called Gitian to make reproducible builds that can be verified by anyone. Instructions on setting up a Gitian VM and building Qtum are provided [in doc/gitian-building.md](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/blob/master/doc/gitian-building.md)\r\n\r\nCommunity Resources\r\n---------\r\n\r\nMake sure to check out these resources as well for more information and to keep up to date with all the latest news about Qtum. At least 1 developer is always around, so if you're developing on Qtum and need help, we'd love to welcome you to our community.  \r\n\r\n* [/r/Qtum on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/)\r\n* [Qtum Telegram Group](https://t.me/joinchat/D5oBaw29NeOdpw6qqqf2lw)\r\n* [@QtumOfficial on Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/qtumofficial)\r\n* [Qtum on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/QtumOfficial/)\r\n* [Qtum Forum](https://forum.qtum.org/)\r\n* [Qtum.org](https://qtum.org/en/)\r\n\r\n\r\nQtum Smart Contract Limitations\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n* EVM smart contracts can not receive coins from or send coins to any address type other than pay-to-pubkeyhash (starts with Q) addresses. This is due to a limitation in the EVM\r\n* Contracts are not allowed to create contracts with an initial endowment of coins. The contract must first be created, and then be sent coins in a separate transaction. Humans are also not allowed to create contracts with an initial endowment of coins.\r\n* Although all of the infrastructure is present, Qtum Core does not currently parse Solidity event data. You must parse this yourself using either `searchlogs` or `-record-log-opcodes` features.\r\n* It is not possible to send a contract coins without also executing the contract. This is also the case of Ethereum. This was promised in earlier discussions and technically does work, but due to lack of time for testing this feature was disabled. We hope to reenable this feature with release of the x86 virtual machine in 2018.\r\n* In Qtum there can be multiple addresses used to create a proof-of-stake block. However, the EVM can only see the first output using the `coinbase` operation in Solidity (this address is also the one registered for the continuous staker rewards after 500 blocks). \r\n\r\nHash Validation\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\r\nHash: SHA512\r\n\r\nIf you would like to validate that the binaries you download are exactly the same as those provided and built by the Qtum team, then you can compare your binaries to the following sha256sum hashes:\r\n\r\n8b3154f78567b0656e65a27035a97d97a800744dacefae0c6cc286c6866e34a4  qtum-0.14.8-osx-unsigned.dmg\r\nc855987b4bb16a333622a1f5b185573c780512789997f9c628a8c06bfae26eb1  qtum-0.14.8-osx-unsigned.tar.gz\r\n10f4c5574ca900e2134dca9ac8880d5ae0f82ec08c4f9aea88da3937c7a08edb  qtum-0.14.8-osx64.tar.gz\r\nedfd26416545caea73c73c62e6326690fa5a239fcbe66300bd42cdf010dd0cb8  src/qtum-0.14.8.tar.gz\r\n1887a60f01571c1156028dd9b7c3316c387517d7177bdb2d870c0458ac28781d  qtum-osx-0.14-res.yml\r\n\r\n1683f03a3448862cae1bcb0069e06b3b7c9805c90e7d43f64b28b78f2d243cb1  qtum-0.14.8-aarch64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz \r\n3ea7fd8a049ac5e6fb86e75944ccd5bf0dec62ae7cbc0caaa92d6e28b7233d5f  qtum-0.14.8-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz \r\n5ef4a469aedd210cdf855155e6f389aacd890ee2cd9309682f01f9a6e60c62c2  qtum-0.14.8-arm-linux-gnueabihf-debug.tar.gz \r\nfe60a3c82116c98fa25bb6dc203ff6211c26bb4977fa4d3df5290a42b9ecc446  qtum-0.14.8-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz \r\n49b7c64c7b3efa598980feb5442823871208de41a57caf4b124639d4962e4270  qtum-0.14.8-i686-pc-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz \r\n86151f07bebcc044780a1b8f7035d4fe344d4f330040b9b6f55bee5f95434974  qtum-0.14.8-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz \r\nf0ec5d129183bb94d4a06b411b648d0948e55eb1b4c1b117afcde4fd75d2aaed  qtum-0.14.8-x86_64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz \r\na94a5e61473eb83a90e34bae29b1d44af8ed966cac09003148778aa63a46e081  qtum-0.14.8-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz \r\nedfd26416545caea73c73c62e6326690fa5a239fcbe66300bd42cdf010dd0cb8  src/qtum-0.14.8.tar.gz \r\ne940134ac98546638fac8f6a3dc5b006ef1a9ed8f1255e1457f4ffd0e6e10de3  qtum-linux-0.14-res.yml \r\n\r\n274c4653cacf2c9519d0fed6e60e121649ad9311570c4300349c1639926f2433  qtum-0.14.8-win-unsigned.tar.gz\r\n9f910b6f6116eba4530ff86461d9b692725bddce19d3732632d1e25a55e07d29  qtum-0.14.8-win32-debug.zip\r\n2c79d901f503ed110ce46453e1ca06db2a62d266fcbf847e33b102dacfeaa6c5  qtum-0.14.8-win32-setup-unsigned.exe\r\n93ffe9cce42ba2aa104249f5b20de17e9fa95c36f68b8909aefb071151f9be46  qtum-0.14.8-win32.zip\r\n9ba4aad9dfd38db2a853b1f30b683db8b701b665b3d3776e9a377483dad29919  qtum-0.14.8-win64-debug.zip\r\n8f3b4c4e138b81b7bc91cf213dd29a311cc3ca5999b5b80b95a0373b8746ce90  qtum-0.14.8-win64-setup-unsigned.exe\r\n61ea512e630bc9a8783488188460ab176d5ec967d8def2438b9ecc3dccf58d13  qtum-0.14.8-win64.zip\r\na7d1d7a038b3b85f48de56c4f283bf0eb0ee621c6d5d53f3584c0f7398e32fcd  src/qtum-0.14.8.tar.gz\r\nce46c4471d174d7983dcff15d2a289ca6111bc6709d8cd16f0e700ad110ff5dc  qtum-win-0.14-res.yml\r\n\r\nIn addition, as of the time of this writing, VirusTotal detects 2 false positives on all of the windows files.

We make no warranties or guarantees of its security or stability.\r\n\r\nUpdate History\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n* v1.1.1: When sending to contracts, the sender address is now the default change address to reduce confusion; fix -salvagewallet so it works with token transactions\r\n* v1.1.0: Add GUI support Qtum QRC tokens, allowing full management of tokens on the Qtum blockchain from the Qt wallet\r\n    * Sending to a contract no longer requires ABI data, allowing easy participation in simple crowdsale contracts\r\n* v1.0.4: Fix bug where certain circumstances when staking could cause the displayed balance to be inaccurate until completely redownloading the blockchain.\r\n* v1.0.3: Fix staker bug that reported false messages; slightly increases staking performance; optimize staker parameters; fix white send button in GUI\r\n* v1.0.2: Various UI fixes, minor gas overflow consensus fix, per-txout exploit fix, testnet mode setup and functioning\r\n* v1.0.1: Fixed network magic bytes and minimum version to ensure the main network does not conflict with the Skynet network\r\n* v1.0: Initial release\r\n\r\nReindex Required When Upgrading from v1.0.1\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhen you first start the Qtum 1.0.2 GUI wallet after using Qtum v1.0.1 it will prompt you that it must reindex the database. This is normal and is a result of switching our internal database format from per-transaction to per-txout. If you use `qtumd -daemon` it will silently fail to start. You need to use `qtumd -daemon -reindex` in this case. \r\n\r\nQtum Documentation and Usage Resources\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nBasic usage resources:\r\n\r\n* [Official Qtum Usage Guide](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/wiki/Qtum-Wallet-Tutorial)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum staking tutorial](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/qtum-staking-tutorial-using-qtum-qt)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum staking tutorial on Raspberry Pi](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/qtum-staking-tutorial-using-qtumd-on-a-raspberry-pi-3)\r\n* [Unofficial guide for keeping your wallet safe](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/encrypting-backing-up-and-restoring-your-qtum-wallet)\r\n* [Block explorer](https://explorer.qtum.org)\r\n* [Unofficial block explorer](https://qtumexplorer.io/)\r\n\r\nDevelopment resources:\r\n\r\n* [Deploying a custom token to Qtum](https://blog.qtum.org/qtum-custom-token-walkthrough-467d725fa27d)\r\n* [Early example faucet contract](http://earlz.net/view/2017/06/30/2144/the-qtum-sparknet-faucet)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum Hello World tutorial](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/quantum-qtum-blockchain-developer-tutorial-hello-world)\r\n\r\nGeneral Info about Qtum:\r\n\r\n* [Mainnet event AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/comments/6zs8t0/official_qtum_ama_thread_starts_at_10pm_beijing/)\r\n* [Qtum's PoS vs CASPER](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/comments/788oa5/qtums_pos_vs_casper_and_the_nothingatstake_problem/)\r\n* [Technical article explaining Qtum's PoS model in depth](http://earlz.net/view/2017/07/27/1904/the-missing-explanation-of-proof-of-stake-version)\r\n* [Unofficial What is Qtum article](https://storeofvalue.github.io/posts/what-is-qtum-without-the-bullshit/)\r\n\r\nQuickstart\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get started with Qtum is to simply download the binaries below. To give a brief breakdown of the different versions available: \r\n\r\n#### Windows\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.7-win64.zip](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.1/qtum-0.14.7-win64.zip) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using Windows.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.7-win64-setup-unsigned.exe](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.1/qtum-0.14.7-win64-setup-unsigned.exe) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using Windows. This includes an installer and will install Qtum system wide.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.7-win32.zip](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.1/qtum-0.14.7-win32.zip) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 machines using Windows. If you have an older Windows computer and don't care about installing Qtum system-wide, \r\n* [qtum-0.14.7-win32-setup-unsigned.exe](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.1/qtum-0.14.7-win32-setup-unsigned.exe) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 machines using Windows. This includes an installer and will install Qtum system wide. If you have an older Windows computer and want to install Qtum then this is for you.\r\n\r\n#### OSX\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.7-osx64.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.1/qtum-0.14.7-osx64.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using OSX. If you use a modern Mac and want development tools, this is what you want; we do not support older 32bit or PowerPC based Macs.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.7-osx-unsigned.dmg](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.1/qtum-0.14.7-osx-unsigned.dmg) - A version of Qtum-Qt built for 64bit x86 machines using OSX in a .DMG installable format. If you use a modern Mac and aren't a developer, this is what you want; we do not support older 32bit or PowerPC based Macs.\r\n\r\n#### Linux\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.7-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.1/qtum-0.14.7-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 PC platforms running Linux. This is probably what you want for older computers running Linux\r\n* [qtum-0.14.7-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.1/qtum-0.14.7-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 PC platforms running Linux. This is probably what you want for any modern PC or server running Linux\r\n* [qtum-0.14.7-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.1/qtum-0.14.7-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz) - A version of qtumd and qtum-cli built for 32bit ARM platforms using Linux. This includes the Raspberry Pi and many of it's clones\r\n* [qtum-0.14.7-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.1/qtum-0.14.7-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of qtumd and qtum-cli built for 64bit ARM platforms using Linux\r\n\r\nBelow in the full list of binaries, there are also versions that include debug symbols. These are useful for developers, but will run slower and are significantly larger to download. \r\n\r\n#### Build Qtum Core\r\n\r\nIf you want to build it from source, it's recommended to follow the specific [\"build\" documentation](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/tree/testnet-2/doc) for your platform. But mostly it boils down to the following:\r\n\r\n1. Clone the qtum source code and cd into `qtum`\r\n\r\n        git clone --recursive https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum.git\r\n        cd qtum\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Build qtum-core:\r\n\r\n    Configure and build the headless qtum binaries as well as the GUI (if Qt is found).\r\n\r\n    You can disable the GUI build by passing `--without-gui` to configure.\r\n\r\n        ./autogen.sh\r\n        ./configure\r\n        make\r\n\r\n3.  It is recommended to build and run the unit tests to ensure everything is working correctly:\r\n\r\n        make check\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you encounter an error like:\r\n\r\n> make[2]: *** No rule to make target \u2018cpp-ethereum/utils/libscrypt/b64.c\u2019, needed by \u2018cpp-ethereum/utils/libscrypt/libbitcoinconsensus_la-b64.lo\u2019.  Stop.\r\n\r\nThen you did not checkout the cpp-ethereum submodule for Qtum. To do that, simply:\r\n\r\n    cd qtum\r\n    git submodule update --init --recursive\r\n\r\nValidate and Reproduce Binaries\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nQtum uses a tool called Gitian to make reproducible builds that can be verified by anyone. Instructions on setting up a Gitian VM and building Qtum are provided [in doc/gitian-building.md](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/blob/master/doc/gitian-building.md)\r\n\r\nCommunity Resources\r\n---------\r\n\r\nMake sure to check out these resources as well for more information and to keep up to date with all the latest news about Qtum. At least 1 developer is always around, so if you're developing on Qtum and need help, we'd love to welcome you to our community.  \r\n\r\n* [/r/Qtum on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/)\r\n* [Qtum Telegram Group](https://t.me/joinchat/D5oBaw29NeOdpw6qqqf2lw)\r\n* [@QtumOfficial on Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/qtumofficial)\r\n* [Qtum on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/QtumOfficial/)\r\n* [Qtum Forum](https://forum.qtum.org/)\r\n* [Qtum.org](https://qtum.org/en/)\r\n\r\n\r\nQtum Smart Contract Limitations\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n* EVM smart contracts can not receive coins from or send coins to any address type other than pay-to-pubkeyhash (starts with Q) addresses. This is due to a limitation in the EVM\r\n* Contracts are not allowed to create contracts with an initial endowment of coins. The contract must first be created, and then be sent coins in a separate transaction. Humans are also not allowed to create contracts with an initial endowment of coins.\r\n* Although all of the infrastructure is present, Qtum Core does not currently parse Solidity event data. You must parse this yourself using either `searchlogs` or `-record-log-opcodes` features.\r\n* It is not possible to send a contract coins without also executing the contract. This is also the case of Ethereum. This was promised in earlier discussions and technically does work, but due to lack of time for testing this feature was disabled. We hope to reenable this feature with release of the x86 virtual machine in 2018.\r\n* In Qtum there can be multiple addresses used to create a proof-of-stake block. However, the EVM can only see the first output using the `coinbase` operation in Solidity (this address is also the one registered for the continuous staker rewards after 500 blocks). \r\n\r\nHash Validation\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\r\nHash: SHA512\r\n\r\nIf you would like to validate that the binaries you download are exactly the same as those provided and built by the Qtum team, then you can compare your binaries to the following sha256sum hashes:\r\n\r\nb852c05722d2f2dc9139ab29c976487c5dc20047c72eb86173bae4680a5aff3b  qtum-0.14.7-osx-unsigned.dmg \r\n4e5a3b3da068835375370522b9fe0cd25cab87af56adbf924714403f92c85150  qtum-0.14.7-osx-unsigned.tar.gz \r\n54f28d3cf61d4f764e68ad4bb64fe03b9c757975cfa085c23e71414d4cd1301a  qtum-0.14.7-osx64.tar.gz \r\na23747d3b59170e0a040a995108b1e4a0a947b06335903a199e4021aada6bc3d  src/qtum-0.14.7.tar.gz \r\necc13ada7fcccf470246e1d9488eeefeb1ceae0431c853cbf8e06a3b60430df6  qtum-osx-0.14-res.yml \r\n\r\n3929ae8b22e32b2f2d6d99e4ec6c654486ac3bc4c663b8054e5243923f504803  qtum-0.14.7-aarch64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\n9b29a0da81b7f3005240a83da9874d10002ed48ec759d57db97e9bc12a9c4eda  qtum-0.14.7-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\ncbee2a21780f33624650e538c4f812d852283c86486f915e285d7455f53ba21a  qtum-0.14.7-arm-linux-gnueabihf-debug.tar.gz\r\n22b885543d4231ca7f6d9c4c023fa2ecb9a44fb630c6cc05a395b21f0fc47f09  qtum-0.14.7-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz\r\n2d58cc607339e19f805529860f927173ed5f9d503a4985fdeaf082ae0d4b44d0  qtum-0.14.7-i686-pc-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\n283753c6f2c8e9848947e8211dffcb08ba9380ce3ab74728858d64239d48ecfb  qtum-0.14.7-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\nb465060bf0e714e4fca305529dc911eca518eb482f53dd652e51af6d5f48fa37  qtum-0.14.7-x86_64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\nf6c49a692734bf021b6c0a53ee32f745b71b7179466eaea98aa398db160a7797  qtum-0.14.7-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\na23747d3b59170e0a040a995108b1e4a0a947b06335903a199e4021aada6bc3d  src/qtum-0.14.7.tar.gz\r\nca422302c4e6d4ab5422acdd138d1eda368e68a229800688d2ed4c4b8c7c3435  qtum-linux-0.14-res.yml\r\n\r\naa7baae9a0710d884da0cae199eb1218644b68b51012d99749385a1436b08213  qtum-0.14.7-win-unsigned.tar.gz\r\n850fc62b59d718691ca35501ded4fcf18c7c54fc863962cc68a8e7b735878f00  qtum-0.14.7-win32-debug.zip\r\n8bc1c9b78063e618d2468623c831d8830238df772169f516a9e56808f2e42ef2  qtum-0.14.7-win32-setup-unsigned.exe\r\n2843fe492f2281076338071ff4f04e9c633b17d9db1e56cf67e45de193044285  qtum-0.14.7-win32.zip\r\n3cb46f26119e85915b681ad8bd99b3b4547cbf590e0d677742d34c31a214a8c9  qtum-0.14.7-win64-debug.zip\r\na642721f52abae5d95a4e644368a851f5e69454e0103d9593eabea75c27f6831  qtum-0.14.7-win64-setup-unsigned.exe\r\nac60106d970b8ff54bdaf592f2725c2fcdeb4967550643ea937dc3233af9087d  qtum-0.14.7-win64.zip\r\ned0e3c8506e9d80dcb443fa160c6bced2b7706c1f7cdd212f836301acf3ba3ff  src/qtum-0.14.7.tar.gz\r\n10b5822b7e3ad878dc14e3cc2156daf63f8e8606e5570e4e73ca768214745612  qtum-win-0.14-res.yml\r\n\r\nIn addition, as of the time of this writing, VirusTotal detects 0 false positives on the Windows 32bit and 64bit zip files and win64 installer, and 1 false positive from 2 vendors on the Windows 32bit installer.\r\n\r\ninstaller win32: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/8bc1c9b78063e618d2468623c831d8830238df772169f516a9e56808f2e42ef2/detection 1 false positive (\"HEUR:Trojan.Win32.Generic\" from Kaspersky and ZoneAlarm)\r\n\r\ninstaller win64 https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/a642721f52abae5d95a4e644368a851f5e69454e0103d9593eabea75c27f6831/detection 0 false positives\r\n\r\nzip win32 https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/2843fe492f2281076338071ff4f04e9c633b17d9db1e56cf67e45de193044285/detection 0 false positives\r\n\r\nzip win64 https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/ac60106d970b8ff54bdaf592f2725c2fcdeb4967550643ea937dc3233af9087d/detection 0 false positives\r\n\r\nYou can validate this message is from Earlz at https://keybase.io/verify\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: Keybase OpenPGP v2.0.76\r\nComment: https://keybase.io/crypto\r\n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\r\nScxZUHP9h/9LgLj/tLSe\r\n=PmzK\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n```",

                "description": "About Qtum and Mainnet Ignition\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nQtum is a decentralized blockchain project built on Bitcoin's UTXO model, with support for Ethereum Virtual Machine based smart contracts, and secured by a proof of stake consensus model. It achieves this through the revolutionary Account Abstraction Layer which allows the EVM to communicate with Qtum's Bitcoin-like UTXO blockchain. For more general information about Qtum as well as links to join our community, go to https://qtum.org\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Qtum Ignition Main Network. This is the main network where the tokens hold value and should be guarded very carefully. There will be a testnet setup soon for developers, in the meantime you can use `-regtest` mode for testing needs. We will announce details about the token swap from QTUM ERC20 coins to QTUM mainnet tokens soon, watch our [website](https://qtum.org) for details about that.  \r\n\r\nThe major features implemented in Qtum Ignition include:\r\n\r\n1. The Ethereum Virtual Machine, which allows for compatibility with most existing Solidity based smart contracts.\r\n2. The Smart Staking Protocol is complete, which is an optimized Proof of Stake implementation designed for a smart contract platform (however, smart contracts can not participate in staking yet).\r\n3. An early and basic smart contract GUI has been implemented that can be used for creating contracts, sending data and Qtum to them, and checking their status by executing them locally. This functionality is similar to Mist's UI right now, but it is still an early version. We will be working on this more to improve it. \r\n4. Regtest mode, which is ideal for developers who wish to create their own private blockchain. It is tuned specifically to make development easier. It will stake blocks automatically every 30 seconds, and can generate proof-of-work blocks instantly as needed.\r\n5. The Decentralized Governance Protocol is completely implemented and functional, which allows certain network parameters to be modified without a fork.\r\n\r\nFor more technical information for how to start developing with Qtum please read the [Guide](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/blob/master/doc/sparknet-guide.md) and also see this tutorial for deploying a simple [faucet smart contract](http://earlz.net/view/2017/06/30/2144/the-qtum-sparknet-faucet) (it hasn't yet been updated for Mainnet for obvious reasons, but all the instructions are the same and you can try them in regtest mode)\r\n\r\nNote: Qtum Core is considered beta software. We make no warranties or guarantees of its security or stability.\r\n\r\nUpdate History\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n* v1.1.0: Add GUI support Qtum QRC tokens, allowing full management of tokens on the Qtum blockchain from the Qt wallet\r\n    * Sending to a contract no longer requires ABI data, allowing easy participation in simple crowdsale contracts\r\n* v1.0.4: Fix bug where certain circumstances when staking could cause the displayed balance to be inaccurate until completely redownloading the blockchain.\r\n* v1.0.3: Fix staker bug that reported false messages; slightly increases staking performance; optimize staker parameters; fix white send button in GUI\r\n* v1.0.2: Various UI fixes, minor gas overflow consensus fix, per-txout exploit fix, testnet mode setup and functioning\r\n* v1.0.1: Fixed network magic bytes and minimum version to ensure the main network does not conflict with the Skynet network\r\n* v1.0: Initial release\r\n\r\nReindex Required When Upgrading from v1.0.1\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhen you first start the Qtum 1.0.2 GUI wallet after using Qtum v1.0.1 it will prompt you that it must reindex the database. This is normal and is a result of switching our internal database format from per-transaction to per-txout. If you use `qtumd -daemon` it will silently fail to start. You need to use `qtumd -daemon -reindex` in this case. \r\n\r\nQtum Documentation and Usage Resources\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nBasic usage resources:\r\n\r\n* [Official Qtum Usage Guide](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/wiki/Qtum-Wallet-Tutorial)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum staking tutorial](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/qtum-staking-tutorial-using-qtum-qt)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum staking tutorial on Raspberry Pi](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/qtum-staking-tutorial-using-qtumd-on-a-raspberry-pi-3)\r\n* [Unofficial guide for keeping your wallet safe](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/encrypting-backing-up-and-restoring-your-qtum-wallet)\r\n* [Block explorer](https://explorer.qtum.org)\r\n* [Unofficial block explorer](https://qtumexplorer.io/)\r\n\r\nDevelopment resources:\r\n\r\n* [Deploying a custom token to Qtum](https://blog.qtum.org/qtum-custom-token-walkthrough-467d725fa27d)\r\n* [Early example faucet contract](http://earlz.net/view/2017/06/30/2144/the-qtum-sparknet-faucet)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum Hello World tutorial](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/quantum-qtum-blockchain-developer-tutorial-hello-world)\r\n\r\nGeneral Info about Qtum:\r\n\r\n* [Mainnet event AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/comments/6zs8t0/official_qtum_ama_thread_starts_at_10pm_beijing/)\r\n* [Qtum's PoS vs CASPER](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/comments/788oa5/qtums_pos_vs_casper_and_the_nothingatstake_problem/)\r\n* [Technical article explaining Qtum's PoS model in depth](http://earlz.net/view/2017/07/27/1904/the-missing-explanation-of-proof-of-stake-version)\r\n* [Unofficial What is Qtum article](https://storeofvalue.github.io/posts/what-is-qtum-without-the-bullshit/)\r\n\r\nQuickstart\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get started with Qtum is to simply download the binaries below. To give a brief breakdown of the different versions available: \r\n\r\n#### Windows\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.6-win64.zip](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.0/qtum-0.14.6-win64.zip) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using Windows.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.6-win64-setup-unsigned.exe](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.0/qtum-0.14.6-win64-setup-unsigned.exe) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using Windows. This includes an installer and will install Qtum system wide.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.6-win32.zip](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.0/qtum-0.14.6-win32.zip) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 machines using Windows. If you have an older Windows computer and don't care about installing Qtum system-wide, \r\n* [qtum-0.14.6-win32-setup-unsigned.exe](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.0/qtum-0.14.6-win32-setup-unsigned.exe) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 machines using Windows. This includes an installer and will install Qtum system wide. If you have an older Windows computer and want to install Qtum then this is for you.\r\n\r\n#### OSX\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.6-osx64.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.0/qtum-0.14.6-osx64.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using OSX. If you use a modern Mac and want development tools, this is what you want; we do not support older 32bit or PowerPC based Macs.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.6-osx-unsigned.dmg](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.0/qtum-0.14.6-osx-unsigned.dmg) - A version of Qtum-Qt built for 64bit x86 machines using OSX in a .DMG installable format. If you use a modern Mac and aren't a developer, this is what you want; we do not support older 32bit or PowerPC based Macs.\r\n\r\n#### Linux\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.6-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.0/qtum-0.14.6-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 PC platforms running Linux. This is probably what you want for older computers running Linux\r\n* [qtum-0.14.6-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.0/qtum-0.14.6-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 PC platforms running Linux. This is probably what you want for any modern PC or server running Linux\r\n* [qtum-0.14.6-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.0/qtum-0.14.6-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz) - A version of qtumd and qtum-cli built for 32bit ARM platforms using Linux. This includes the Raspberry Pi and many of it's clones\r\n* [qtum-0.14.6-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.0/qtum-0.14.6-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of qtumd and qtum-cli built for 64bit ARM platforms using Linux\r\n\r\nBelow in the full list of binaries, there are also versions that include debug symbols. These are useful for developers, but will run slower and are significantly larger to download. \r\n\r\n#### Build Qtum Core\r\n\r\nIf you want to build it from source, it's recommended to follow the specific [\"build\" documentation](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/tree/testnet-2/doc) for your platform. But mostly it boils down to the following:\r\n\r\n1. Clone the qtum source code and cd into `qtum`\r\n\r\n        git clone --recursive https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum.git\r\n        cd qtum\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Build qtum-core:\r\n\r\n    Configure and build the headless qtum binaries as well as the GUI (if Qt is found).\r\n\r\n    You can disable the GUI build by passing `--without-gui` to configure.\r\n\r\n        ./autogen.sh\r\n        ./configure\r\n        make\r\n\r\n3.  It is recommended to build and run the unit tests to ensure everything is working correctly:\r\n\r\n        make check\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you encounter an error like:\r\n\r\n> make[2]: *** No rule to make target \u2018cpp-ethereum/utils/libscrypt/b64.c\u2019, needed by \u2018cpp-ethereum/utils/libscrypt/libbitcoinconsensus_la-b64.lo\u2019.  Stop.\r\n\r\nThen you did not checkout the cpp-ethereum submodule for Qtum. To do that, simply:\r\n\r\n    cd qtum\r\n    git submodule update --init --recursive\r\n\r\nValidate and Reproduce Binaries\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nQtum uses a tool called Gitian to make reproducible builds that can be verified by anyone. Instructions on setting up a Gitian VM and building Qtum are provided [in doc/gitian-building.md](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/blob/master/doc/gitian-building.md)\r\n\r\nCommunity Resources\r\n---------\r\n\r\nMake sure to check out these resources as well for more information and to keep up to date with all the latest news about Qtum. At least 1 developer is always around, so if you're developing on Qtum and need help, we'd love to welcome you to our community.  \r\n\r\n* [/r/Qtum on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/)\r\n* [Qtum Telegram Group](https://t.me/joinchat/D5oBaw29NeOdpw6qqqf2lw)\r\n* [@QtumOfficial on Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/qtumofficial)\r\n* [Qtum on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/QtumOfficial/)\r\n* [Qtum Forum](https://forum.qtum.org/)\r\n* [Qtum.org](https://qtum.org/en/)\r\n\r\n\r\nQtum Smart Contract Limitations\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n* EVM smart contracts can not receive coins from or send coins to any address type other than pay-to-pubkeyhash (starts with Q) addresses. This is due to a limitation in the EVM\r\n* Contracts are not allowed to create contracts with an initial endowment of coins. The contract must first be created, and then be sent coins in a separate transaction. Humans are also not allowed to create contracts with an initial endowment of coins.\r\n* Although all of the infrastructure is present, Qtum Core does not currently parse Solidity event data. You must parse this yourself using either `searchlogs` or `-record-log-opcodes` features.\r\n* It is not possible to send a contract coins without also executing the contract. This is also the case of Ethereum. This was promised in earlier discussions and technically does work, but due to lack of time for testing this feature was disabled. We hope to reenable this feature with release of the x86 virtual machine in 2018.\r\n* In Qtum there can be multiple addresses used to create a proof-of-stake block. However, the EVM can only see the first output using the `coinbase` operation in Solidity (this address is also the one registered for the continuous staker rewards after 500 blocks). \r\n\r\nHash Validation\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\r\nHash: SHA512\r\n\r\nIf you would like to validate that the binaries you download are exactly the same as those provided and built by the Qtum team, then you can compare your binaries to the following sha256sum hashes:\r\n\r\nf969b3f59a8a62bed2419766580cf0a9849db141e5fb22adc538ba27dc26f2ba  qtum-0.14.6-osx-unsigned.dmg\r\n143cc4dd0dc7c27d37f0577be90244c27d9bc774f1ad2f880cd6b2d2eff48db3  qtum-0.14.6-osx-unsigned.tar.gz\r\n58de033b5f091de665e2d50e1c18adbf2867451c555e187582f36238b4dfcbfa  qtum-0.14.6-osx64.tar.gz\r\n1a4f407ad165177a9950c33053778e44c5b1a1d5d913a8fcd27f7ada698087f8  src/qtum-0.14.6.tar.gz\r\n9aac11978cf3aa1fa814885253fdb0c59b3d050113597786d07446929dc6b01a  qtum-osx-0.14-res.yml\r\n\r\n2a404b42149dc1ef617b1d582e5690cb2d4cb386e4e4e6aa94fc412c8017ef41685  qtum-0.14.6-aarch64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\n8dae9d9a8bc38d18b53bafa1ac4a87c93b3308cea69c10558c04cbfe155249de  qtum-0.14.6-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\n206a6b32953ebafa5cb26c435334fba780222a84860025953cefe623487614b1  qtum-0.14.6-arm-linux-gnueabihf-debug.tar.gz\r\n1063aa207afa9bf61e4633a28d8ec8c3d2f72f8cc43e284f58346a8a96bf9970  qtum-0.14.6-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz\r\nd2eb64462f63bd5e83a822103d0edb6d6be1ed2c1bc91ac26000dfffb42d0a1b  qtum-0.14.6-i686-pc-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\ne1a8790e4810c6a999fa76119b319f4cffaa336f3716477b02b00f77b1182eaf  qtum-0.14.6-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\nb267fe4342610e17351528d1334a427092f1e36479cd68e63d7e76ccc21e7445  qtum-0.14.6-x86_64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\n35122c1a05745aad43b6044c83a9d93c0c0725b2461c40eab5afd5dd598cd4ae  qtum-0.14.6-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\n1a4f407ad165177a9950c33053778e44c5b1a1d5d913a8fcd27f7ada698087f8  src/qtum-0.14.6.tar.gz\r\n89484b7caa427959dfee542358489e7a1c50a840f286102af0a428e3cfd0891f  qtum-linux-0.14-res.yml\r\n\r\na1ebed92a95f69008116e55585deacea18279407bd6612664d1d349c4588a3a3  qtum-0.14.6-win-unsigned.tar.gz\r\n818b32af02061c3c173b538701297018ba90c96a90d207837a7ee2071483ca39  qtum-0.14.6-win32-debug.zip\r\n6c2d3d0bdb947cab3a3a4e360c007c25644ed58806edf42aa334af37431a664b  qtum-0.14.6-win32-setup-unsigned.exe\r\n9b5ab577dd843da6195d0d0d78f4676a468e56d73936c774cdebd970f2d24a23  qtum-0.14.6-win32.zip\r\nce0e1d041a771bfd83a934208ca6fbc28f0cb5cbdc415d0d86d527c794900bb2  qtum-0.14.6-win64-debug.zip\r\n28f5e68958eebb97499b6e150b922ede2cd6a80b4d385eeb19e073a38e066b33  qtum-0.14.6-win64-setup-unsigned.exe\r\n715e65dc007a52d52dc1bb43a723cdd84a225d843c4c2786e8c402fdae3a0440  qtum-0.14.6-win64.zip\r\n44c87b827304adef7febf9feaf39ef897eadaf42dbadf52e22be639dc47799a6  src/qtum-0.14.6.tar.gz\r\nbb8f6868c07e0aab8a6d9fd0f096b4c2a4e13651baf1b958bd9fe8c631ea2574  qtum-win-0.14-res.yml\r\n\r\nIn addition, as of the time of this writing, VirusTotal detects 0 false positives on the Windows 32bit and 64bit zip files, and 1 false positive on the Windows 32bit and 64bit installer:\r\n\r\ninstaller win32: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/6c2d3d0bdb947cab3a3a4e360c007c25644ed58806edf42aa334af37431a664b/detection 1 false positive (\"unsafe\" by Cylance)\r\n\r\ninstaller win64 https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/28f5e68958eebb97499b6e150b922ede2cd6a80b4d385eeb19e073a38e066b33/detection 1 false positive (\"unsafe\" by Cylance)\r\n\r\nzip win32 https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/9b5ab577dd843da6195d0d0d78f4676a468e56d73936c774cdebd970f2d24a23/detection 0 false positives\r\n\r\nzip win64 https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/715e65dc007a52d52dc1bb43a723cdd84a225d843c4c2786e8c402fdae3a0440/detection 0 false positives\r\n\r\nYou can validate this message is from Earlz at https://keybase.io/verify\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: Keybase OpenPGP v2.0.76\r\nComment: https://keybase.io/crypto\r\n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\r\n9iG+3V1xROLj+cm0N9KL\r\n=+svp\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n```\r\n",

                "description": "About Qtum and Mainnet Ignition\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nQtum is a decentralized blockchain project built on Bitcoin's UTXO model, with support for Ethereum Virtual Machine based smart contracts, and secured by a proof of stake consensus model. It achieves this through the revolutionary Account Abstraction Layer which allows the EVM to communicate with Qtum's Bitcoin-like UTXO blockchain. For more general information about Qtum as well as links to join our community, go to https://qtum.org\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Qtum Ignition Main Network. This is the main network where the tokens hold value and should be guarded very carefully. There will be a testnet setup soon for developers, in the meantime you can use `-regtest` mode for testing needs. We will announce details about the token swap from QTUM ERC20 coins to QTUM mainnet tokens soon, watch our [website](https://qtum.org) for details about that.  \r\n\r\nThe major features implemented in Qtum Ignition include:\r\n\r\n1. The Ethereum Virtual Machine, which allows for compatibility with most existing Solidity based smart contracts.\r\n2. The Smart Staking Protocol is complete, which is an optimized Proof of Stake implementation designed for a smart contract platform (however, smart contracts can not participate in staking yet).\r\n3. An early and basic smart contract GUI has been implemented that can be used for creating contracts, sending data and Qtum to them, and checking their status by executing them locally. This functionality is similar to Mist's UI right now, but it is still an early version. We will be working on this more to improve it. \r\n4. Regtest mode, which is ideal for developers who wish to create their own private blockchain. It is tuned specifically to make development easier. It will stake blocks automatically every 30 seconds, and can generate proof-of-work blocks instantly as needed.\r\n5. The Decentralized Governance Protocol is completely implemented and functional, which allows certain network parameters to be modified without a fork.\r\n\r\nFor more technical information for how to start developing with Qtum please read the [Guide](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/blob/master/doc/sparknet-guide.md) and also see this tutorial for deploying a simple [faucet smart contract](http://earlz.net/view/2017/06/30/2144/the-qtum-sparknet-faucet) (it hasn't yet been updated for Mainnet for obvious reasons, but all the instructions are the same and you can try them in regtest mode)\r\n\r\nNote: Qtum Core is considered beta software. We make no warranties or guarantees of its security or stability.\r\n\r\nUpdate History\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n* v1.0.4: Fix bug where certain circumstances when staking could cause the displayed balance to be inaccurate until completely redownloading the blockchain.\r\n* v1.0.3: Fix staker bug that reported false messages; slightly increases staking performance; optimize staker parameters; fix white send button in GUI\r\n* v1.0.2: Various UI fixes, minor gas overflow consensus fix, per-txout exploit fix, testnet mode setup and functioning\r\n* v1.0.1: Fixed network magic bytes and minimum version to ensure the main network does not conflict with the Skynet network\r\n* v1.0: Initial release\r\n\r\nReindex Required When Upgrading from v1.0.1\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhen you first start the Qtum 1.0.2 GUI wallet after using Qtum v1.0.1 it will prompt you that it must reindex the database. This is normal and is a result of switching our internal database format from per-transaction to per-txout. If you use `qtumd -daemon` it will silently fail to start. You need to use `qtumd -daemon -reindex` in this case. \r\n\r\nQtum Documentation and Usage Resources\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nBasic usage resources:\r\n\r\n* [Official Qtum Usage Guide](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/wiki/Qtum-Wallet-Tutorial)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum staking tutorial](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/qtum-staking-tutorial-using-qtum-qt)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum staking tutorial on Raspberry Pi](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/qtum-staking-tutorial-using-qtumd-on-a-raspberry-pi-3)\r\n* [Unofficial guide for keeping your wallet safe](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/encrypting-backing-up-and-restoring-your-qtum-wallet)\r\n* [Block explorer](https://explorer.qtum.org)\r\n* [Unofficial block explorer](https://qtumexplorer.io/)\r\n\r\nDevelopment resources:\r\n\r\n* [Deploying a custom token to Qtum](https://blog.qtum.org/qtum-custom-token-walkthrough-467d725fa27d)\r\n* [Early example faucet contract](http://earlz.net/view/2017/06/30/2144/the-qtum-sparknet-faucet)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum Hello World tutorial](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/quantum-qtum-blockchain-developer-tutorial-hello-world)\r\n\r\nGeneral Info about Qtum:\r\n\r\n* [Mainnet event AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/comments/6zs8t0/official_qtum_ama_thread_starts_at_10pm_beijing/)\r\n* [Qtum's PoS vs CASPER](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/comments/788oa5/qtums_pos_vs_casper_and_the_nothingatstake_problem/)\r\n* [Technical article explaining Qtum's PoS model in depth](http://earlz.net/view/2017/07/27/1904/the-missing-explanation-of-proof-of-stake-version)\r\n* [Unofficial What is Qtum article](https://storeofvalue.github.io/posts/what-is-qtum-without-the-bullshit/)\r\n\r\nQuickstart\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get started with Qtum is to simply download the binaries below. To give a brief breakdown of the different versions available: \r\n\r\n#### Windows\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.5-win64.zip](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.4/qtum-0.14.5-win64.zip) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using Windows.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.5-win64-setup-unsigned.exe](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.4/qtum-0.14.5-win64-setup-unsigned.exe) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using Windows. This includes an installer and will install Qtum system wide.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.5-win32.zip](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.4/qtum-0.14.5-win32.zip) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 machines using Windows. If you have an older Windows computer and don't care about installing Qtum system-wide, \r\n* [qtum-0.14.5-win32-setup-unsigned.exe](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.4/qtum-0.14.5-win32-setup-unsigned.exe) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 machines using Windows. This includes an installer and will install Qtum system wide. If you have an older Windows computer and want to install Qtum then this is for you.\r\n\r\n#### OSX\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.5-osx64.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.4/qtum-0.14.5-osx64.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using OSX. If you use a modern Mac and want development tools, this is what you want; we do not support older 32bit or PowerPC based Macs.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.5-osx-unsigned.dmg](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.4/qtum-0.14.5-osx-unsigned.dmg) - A version of Qtum-Qt built for 64bit x86 machines using OSX in a .DMG installable format. If you use a modern Mac and aren't a developer, this is what you want; we do not support older 32bit or PowerPC based Macs.\r\n\r\n#### Linux\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.5-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.4/qtum-0.14.5-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 PC platforms running Linux. This is probably what you want for older computers running Linux\r\n* [qtum-0.14.5-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.4/qtum-0.14.5-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 PC platforms running Linux. This is probably what you want for any modern PC or server running Linux\r\n* [qtum-0.14.5-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.4/qtum-0.14.5-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz) - A version of qtumd and qtum-cli built for 32bit ARM platforms using Linux. This includes the Raspberry Pi and many of it's clones\r\n* [qtum-0.14.5-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.4/qtum-0.14.5-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of qtumd and qtum-cli built for 64bit ARM platforms using Linux\r\n\r\nBelow in the full list of binaries, there are also versions that include debug symbols. These are useful for developers, but will run slower and are significantly larger to download. \r\n\r\n#### Build Qtum Core\r\n\r\nIf you want to build it from source, it's recommended to follow the specific [\"build\" documentation](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/tree/testnet-2/doc) for your platform. But mostly it boils down to the following:\r\n\r\n1. Clone the qtum source code and cd into `qtum`\r\n\r\n        git clone --recursive https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum.git\r\n        cd qtum\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Build qtum-core:\r\n\r\n    Configure and build the headless qtum binaries as well as the GUI (if Qt is found).\r\n\r\n    You can disable the GUI build by passing `--without-gui` to configure.\r\n\r\n        ./autogen.sh\r\n        ./configure\r\n        make\r\n\r\n3.  It is recommended to build and run the unit tests to ensure everything is working correctly:\r\n\r\n        make check\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you encounter an error like:\r\n\r\n> make[2]: *** No rule to make target \u2018cpp-ethereum/utils/libscrypt/b64.c\u2019, needed by \u2018cpp-ethereum/utils/libscrypt/libbitcoinconsensus_la-b64.lo\u2019.  Stop.\r\n\r\nThen you did not checkout the cpp-ethereum submodule for Qtum. To do that, simply:\r\n\r\n    cd qtum\r\n    git submodule update --init --recursive\r\n\r\nValidate and Reproduce Binaries\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nQtum uses a tool called Gitian to make reproducible builds that can be verified by anyone. Instructions on setting up a Gitian VM and building Qtum are provided [in doc/gitian-building.md](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/blob/master/doc/gitian-building.md)\r\n\r\nCommunity Resources\r\n---------\r\n\r\nMake sure to check out these resources as well for more information and to keep up to date with all the latest news about Qtum. At least 1 developer is always around, so if you're developing on Qtum and need help, we'd love to welcome you to our community.  \r\n\r\n* [/r/Qtum on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/)\r\n* [Qtum Telegram Group](https://t.me/joinchat/D5oBaw29NeOdpw6qqqf2lw)\r\n* [@QtumOfficial on Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/qtumofficial)\r\n* [Qtum on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/QtumOfficial/)\r\n* [Qtum Forum](https://forum.qtum.org/)\r\n* [Qtum.org](https://qtum.org/en/)\r\n\r\n\r\nQtum Smart Contract Limitations\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n* EVM smart contracts can not receive coins from or send coins to any address type other than pay-to-pubkeyhash (starts with Q) addresses. This is due to a limitation in the EVM\r\n* Contracts are not allowed to create contracts with an initial endowment of coins. The contract must first be created, and then be sent coins in a separate transaction. Humans are also not allowed to create contracts with an initial endowment of coins.\r\n* Although all of the infrastructure is present, Qtum Core does not currently parse Solidity event data. You must parse this yourself using either `searchlogs` or `-record-log-opcodes` features.\r\n* It is not possible to send a contract coins without also executing the contract. This is also the case of Ethereum. This was promised in earlier discussions and technically does work, but due to lack of time for testing this feature was disabled. We hope to reenable this feature with release of the x86 virtual machine in 2018.\r\n* In Qtum there can be multiple addresses used to create a proof-of-stake block. However, the EVM can only see the first output using the `coinbase` operation in Solidity (this address is also the one registered for the continuous staker rewards after 500 blocks). \r\n\r\nHash Validation\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\r\nHash: SHA512\r\n\r\nIf you would like to validate that the binaries you download are exactly the same as those provided and built by the Qtum team, then you can compare your binaries to the following sha256sum hashes:\r\n\r\n191cea2e4d1e1e6eda48a2044352497503db864bcb9d37e82f54f0ac0993b5c1  qtum-0.14.5-osx-unsigned.dmg\r\n0a07a7cf7b66dcc214c551825672aaf0055d5047b621c67e8d7113bbeb2a6d49  qtum-0.14.5-osx-unsigned.tar.gz\r\n16865c934a79350f9378baf49fbce5ef482d9f5ea4e90ffdd4f200344032f062  qtum-0.14.5-osx64.tar.gz\r\n3d056fdd4d19ac7e7323f933c98650bc787becd72d4aad8a495e3017cf686589  src/qtum-0.14.5.tar.gz\r\nb8e1d0096b041fdbbda6b086321da1b61289147653ce7d525bfc2c398e33e7f0  qtum-osx-0.14-res.yml\r\n\r\n2a4d502f9b914c021ef83fd10ccfc628369ce4bed3818ae9f078a4192c627380  qtum-0.14.5-aarch64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\nabc7f201f1621cc960a1dd8bb1fb60c7d50ac6a2a8e589c25183c687022d0a90  qtum-0.14.5-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\n50e9c53284ae8a33f35b6db3ef88e91bdb433211a1bee7dffacdf8c68796a8b1  qtum-0.14.5-arm-linux-gnueabihf-debug.tar.gz\r\n113d7b889f6a8112e0a0749c5570ed6f8e0425a71be1c9129f94b46027dd2b4b  qtum-0.14.5-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz\r\ncd03398747c543eb298a342a98f709058f5a819c741fd9f0287f82915f5f97f3  qtum-0.14.5-i686-pc-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\nc944edc6b0ae607ee0c1ae265c3690662c1341d71acd4be339786d0ed033381b  qtum-0.14.5-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\n91e181510e707f214c1a33a5801280b7ff2cfce35e58b5604adad2affceab5f7  qtum-0.14.5-x86_64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\n754dac3e4e719b88851281175e660708f502427a846a33778e3a5331aa06c576  qtum-0.14.5-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\n3d056fdd4d19ac7e7323f933c98650bc787becd72d4aad8a495e3017cf686589  src/qtum-0.14.5.tar.gz\r\nd27216322779b4305f62a9f2d1905c0fef0b8c6d13243e93bf1857116749fa8d  qtum-linux-0.14-res.yml\r\n\r\n69b316b9d069f0374255496fcc28540279fc40725f7bb4211aa6a84682159618  qtum-0.14.5-win-unsigned.tar.gz\r\n23874dfbf194945426529f6e9bd116908e10b345221c5e94693b700c6bc3321e  qtum-0.14.5-win32-debug.zip\r\n856c4a85b53eff7c63787ab0498852e2f16af8088415e93ce5a534f719768fe2  qtum-0.14.5-win32-setup-unsigned.exe\r\n6364f81877b8867d4fbf35cc28067b470ef8abc6d3d63d9eb58283ec3abac317  qtum-0.14.5-win32.zip\r\nb8cc0d50513ebae0e3a591090c9f536c618a6434b5065b7fe5fba8053a2c8ede  qtum-0.14.5-win64-debug.zip\r\n77a555d8d4ccf08b112b8424c562b214fbd94f352454235102ffe672d533aff4  qtum-0.14.5-win64-setup-unsigned.exe\r\n3b89aef0e01af7d30424b3e5db15dde3da3f675eb731cef61304c5f8f5b8e90e  qtum-0.14.5-win64.zip\r\n0f2b3338e9e941f60a02cc923767c36983c37104658327369bc72ae6ab5a18f0  src/qtum-0.14.5.tar.gz\r\n448a1a2ddbee689492dc322ebd4b3bc3c3463ff628f310e9a7e45c00d3ed9cd8  qtum-win-0.14-res.yml\r\n\r\nIn addition, as of the time of this writing, VirusTotal detects 0 false positives on the Windows 32bit and 64bit zip files, 0 false positives on the Windows 32bit installer, and 1 false positive on the Windows 64bit installer:\r\n\r\ninstaller win32: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/856c4a85b53eff7c63787ab0498852e2f16af8088415e93ce5a534f719768fe2/detection 0 false positives.\r\n\r\ninstaller win64 https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/3b89aef0e01af7d30424b3e5db15dde3da3f675eb731cef61304c5f8f5b8e90e/detection 1 false positive(AhnLab-V3 Trojan/MSIl.Disfa.C2221224)\r\n\r\nzip win32 https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/6364f81877b8867d4fbf35cc28067b470ef8abc6d3d63d9eb58283ec3abac317/detection 0 false positives\r\n\r\nzip win64 https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/77a555d8d4ccf08b112b8424c562b214fbd94f352454235102ffe672d533aff4/detection 0 false positives\r\n\r\nYou can validate this message is from Earlz at https://keybase.io/verify\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: Keybase OpenPGP v2.0.76\r\nComment: https://keybase.io/crypto\r\n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\r\nAp3KyxYWxaOGfdxrI5MC\r\n=WDoX\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n\r\n```\r\n",

                "description": "About Qtum and Mainnet Ignition\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nQtum is a decentralized blockchain project built on Bitcoin's UTXO model, with support for Ethereum Virtual Machine based smart contracts, and secured by a proof of stake consensus model. It achieves this through the revolutionary Account Abstraction Layer which allows the EVM to communicate with Qtum's Bitcoin-like UTXO blockchain. For more general information about Qtum as well as links to join our community, go to https://qtum.org\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Qtum Ignition Main Network. This is the main network where the tokens hold value and should be guarded very carefully. There will be a testnet setup soon for developers, in the meantime you can use `-regtest` mode for testing needs. We will announce details about the token swap from QTUM ERC20 coins to QTUM mainnet tokens soon, watch our [website](https://qtum.org) for details about that.  \r\n\r\nThe major features implemented in Qtum Ignition include:\r\n\r\n1. The Ethereum Virtual Machine, which allows for compatibility with most existing Solidity based smart contracts.\r\n2. The Smart Staking Protocol is complete, which is an optimized Proof of Stake implementation designed for a smart contract platform (however, smart contracts can not participate in staking yet).\r\n3. An early and basic smart contract GUI has been implemented that can be used for creating contracts, sending data and Qtum to them, and checking their status by executing them locally. This functionality is similar to Mist's UI right now, but it is still an early version. We will be working on this more to improve it. \r\n4. Regtest mode, which is ideal for developers who wish to create their own private blockchain. It is tuned specifically to make development easier. It will stake blocks automatically every 30 seconds, and can generate proof-of-work blocks instantly as needed.\r\n5. The Decentralized Governance Protocol is completely implemented and functional, which allows certain network parameters to be modified without a fork.\r\n\r\nFor more technical information for how to start developing with Qtum please read the [Guide](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/blob/master/doc/sparknet-guide.md) and also see this tutorial for deploying a simple [faucet smart contract](http://earlz.net/view/2017/06/30/2144/the-qtum-sparknet-faucet) (it hasn't yet been updated for Mainnet for obvious reasons, but all the instructions are the same and you can try them in regtest mode)\r\n\r\nNote: Qtum Core is considered beta software. We make no warranties or guarantees of its security or stability.\r\n\r\nUpdate History\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n* v1.0.3: Fix staker bug that reported false messages; slightly increases staking performance; optimize staker parameters; fix white send button in GUI\r\n* v1.0.2: Various UI fixes, minor gas overflow consensus fix, per-txout exploit fix, testnet mode setup and functioning\r\n* v1.0.1: Fixed network magic bytes and minimum version to ensure the main network does not conflict with the Skynet network\r\n* v1.0: Initial release\r\n\r\nReindex Required When Upgrading from v1.0.1\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhen you first start the Qtum 1.0.2 GUI wallet after using Qtum v1.0.1 it will prompt you that it must reindex the database. This is normal and is a result of switching our internal database format from per-transaction to per-txout. If you use `qtumd -daemon` it will silently fail to start. You need to use `qtumd -daemon -reindex` in this case. \r\n\r\nQtum Documentation and Usage Resources\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nBasic usage resources:\r\n\r\n* [Official Qtum Usage Guide](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/wiki/Qtum-Wallet-Tutorial)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum staking tutorial](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/qtum-staking-tutorial-using-qtum-qt)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum staking tutorial on Raspberry Pi](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/qtum-staking-tutorial-using-qtumd-on-a-raspberry-pi-3)\r\n* [Unofficial guide for keeping your wallet safe](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/encrypting-backing-up-and-restoring-your-qtum-wallet)\r\n* [Block explorer](https://explorer.qtum.org)\r\n* [Unofficial block explorer](https://qtumexplorer.io/)\r\n\r\nDevelopment resources:\r\n\r\n* [Deploying a custom token to Qtum](https://blog.qtum.org/qtum-custom-token-walkthrough-467d725fa27d)\r\n* [Early example faucet contract](http://earlz.net/view/2017/06/30/2144/the-qtum-sparknet-faucet)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum Hello World tutorial](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/quantum-qtum-blockchain-developer-tutorial-hello-world)\r\n\r\nGeneral Info about Qtum:\r\n\r\n* [Mainnet event AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/comments/6zs8t0/official_qtum_ama_thread_starts_at_10pm_beijing/)\r\n* [Qtum's PoS vs CASPER](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/comments/788oa5/qtums_pos_vs_casper_and_the_nothingatstake_problem/)\r\n* [Technical article explaining Qtum's PoS model in depth](http://earlz.net/view/2017/07/27/1904/the-missing-explanation-of-proof-of-stake-version)\r\n* [Unofficial What is Qtum article](https://storeofvalue.github.io/posts/what-is-qtum-without-the-bullshit/)\r\n\r\nQuickstart\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get started with Qtum is to simply download the binaries below. To give a brief breakdown of the different versions available: \r\n\r\n#### Windows\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.4-win64.zip](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.3/qtum-0.14.4-win64.zip) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using Windows.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.4-win64-setup-unsigned.exe](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.3/qtum-0.14.4-win64-setup-unsigned.exe) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using Windows.

If you have an older Windows computer and don't care about installing Qtum system-wide, \r\n* [qtum-0.14.4-win32-setup-unsigned.exe](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.3/qtum-0.14.4-win32-setup-unsigned.exe) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 machines using Windows. This includes an installer and will install Qtum system wide. If you have an older Windows computer and want to install Qtum then this is for you.\r\n\r\n#### OSX\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.4-osx64.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.3/qtum-0.14.4-osx64.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using OSX. If you use a modern Mac and want development tools, this is what you want; we do not support older 32bit or PowerPC based Macs.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.4-osx-unsigned.dmg](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.3/qtum-0.14.4-osx-unsigned.dmg) - A version of Qtum-Qt built for 64bit x86 machines using OSX in a .DMG installable format. If you use a modern Mac and aren't a developer, this is what you want; we do not support older 32bit or PowerPC based Macs.\r\n\r\n#### Linux\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.4-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.3/qtum-0.14.4-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 PC platforms running Linux. This is probably what you want for older computers running Linux\r\n* [qtum-0.14.4-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.3/qtum-0.14.4-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 PC platforms running Linux. This is probably what you want for any modern PC or server running Linux\r\n* [qtum-0.14.4-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.3/qtum-0.14.4-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz) - A version of qtumd and qtum-cli built for 32bit ARM platforms using Linux. This includes the Raspberry Pi and many of it's clones\r\n* [qtum-0.14.4-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.3/qtum-0.14.4-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of qtumd and qtum-cli built for 64bit ARM platforms using Linux\r\n\r\nBelow in the full list of binaries, there are also versions that include debug symbols. These are useful for developers, but will run slower and are significantly larger to download. \r\n\r\n#### Build Qtum Core\r\n\r\nIf you want to build it from source, it's recommended to follow the specific [\"build\" documentation](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/tree/testnet-2/doc) for your platform. But mostly it boils down to the following:\r\n\r\n1. Clone the qtum source code and cd into `qtum`\r\n\r\n        git clone --recursive https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum.git\r\n        cd qtum\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Build qtum-core:\r\n\r\n    Configure and build the headless qtum binaries as well as the GUI (if Qt is found).\r\n\r\n    You can disable the GUI build by passing `--without-gui` to configure.\r\n\r\n        ./autogen.sh\r\n        ./configure\r\n        make\r\n\r\n3.  It is recommended to build and run the unit tests to ensure everything is working correctly:\r\n\r\n        make check\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you encounter an error like:\r\n\r\n> make[2]: *** No rule to make target \u2018cpp-ethereum/utils/libscrypt/b64.c\u2019, needed by \u2018cpp-ethereum/utils/libscrypt/libbitcoinconsensus_la-b64.lo\u2019.  Stop.\r\n\r\nThen you did not checkout the cpp-ethereum submodule for Qtum. To do that, simply:\r\n\r\n    cd qtum\r\n    git submodule update --init --recursive\r\n\r\nValidate and Reproduce Binaries\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nQtum uses a tool called Gitian to make reproducible builds that can be verified by anyone. Instructions on setting up a Gitian VM and building Qtum are provided [in doc/gitian-building.md](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/blob/master/doc/gitian-building.md)\r\n\r\nCommunity Resources\r\n---------\r\n\r\nMake sure to check out these resources as well for more information and to keep up to date with all the latest news about Qtum. At least 1 developer is always around, so if you're developing on Qtum and need help, we'd love to welcome you to our community.  \r\n\r\n* [/r/Qtum on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/)\r\n* [Qtum Telegram Group](https://t.me/joinchat/D5oBaw29NeOdpw6qqqf2lw)\r\n* [@QtumOfficial on Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/qtumofficial)\r\n* [Qtum on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/QtumOfficial/)\r\n* [Qtum Forum](https://forum.qtum.org/)\r\n* [Qtum.org](https://qtum.org/en/)\r\n\r\n\r\nQtum Smart Contract Limitations\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n* EVM smart contracts can not receive coins from or send coins to any address type other than pay-to-pubkeyhash (starts with Q) addresses. This is due to a limitation in the EVM\r\n* Contracts are not allowed to create contracts with an initial endowment of coins. The contract must first be created, and then be sent coins in a separate transaction. Humans are also not allowed to create contracts with an initial endowment of coins.\r\n* Although all of the infrastructure is present, Qtum Core does not currently parse Solidity event data. You must parse this yourself using either `searchlogs` or `-record-log-opcodes` features.\r\n* It is not possible to send a contract coins without also executing the contract. This is also the case of Ethereum. This was promised in earlier discussions and technically does work, but due to lack of time for testing this feature was disabled. We hope to reenable this feature with release of the x86 virtual machine in 2018.\r\n* In Qtum there can be multiple addresses used to create a proof-of-stake block. However, the EVM can only see the first output using the `coinbase` operation in Solidity (this address is also the one registered for the continuous staker rewards after 500 blocks). \r\n\r\nHash Validation\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\r\nHash: SHA512\r\n\r\nIf you would like to validate that the binaries you download are exactly the same as those provided and built by the Qtum team, then you can compare your binaries to the following sha256sum hashes:\r\n\r\n    48c54cddbdd28d386fe18c7cddc46cfc5d1877775488048d4d7932fd2b666111  qtum-0.14.4-osx-unsigned.dmg\r\n    5b3f3306450037b8cbb7d10b4adbcfa675d889cf6b1ea23df0bd37dac89a374d  qtum-0.14.4-osx-unsigned.tar.gz\r\n    c270743c35ad578aa204670ec12a20e85d85d68f950bd302582d16627764e659  qtum-0.14.4-osx64.tar.gz\r\n    0767ef83a677aee4ecc63bcafe90b038fd75d6a0fbf09ebd91cc6c1beb2850a2  src/qtum-0.14.4.tar.gz\r\n    4cfc7af2d8080ddea9f203812d8e7657c221b368d53fc5afdbc9d082db103c64  qtum-osx-0.14-res.yml\r\n\r\n    6e16b09f1564d75e653297b0034b84098f1c5c00ba49ab3be26aabfacbd018aa  qtum-0.14.4-aarch64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\n    39acc0c9e422f55a0e830a84167522868edc2179036075f6dcaa0b0850d9c16f  qtum-0.14.4-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\n    19edd1a5e3a239f210c5f4d1373de90aea86a6e9b6a4ec2b14e0f7c67a0df9bc  qtum-0.14.4-arm-linux-gnueabihf-debug.tar.gz\r\n    fa0c212b2d883cf75a1337c8c5a457a42791442c0dc5d94bbaffec2951897247  qtum-0.14.4-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz\r\n    3f67d2c5a02c98224ffa53c374ba31c5135cecb92c32ff29b2552eff525e7008  qtum-0.14.4-i686-pc-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\n    6d30d803a767ce37d426336353d75fe643694fcd29b320cd15a958dff3a4d32a  qtum-0.14.4-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\n    eb2468fc5421ca855d87070f70b67ec7a84894a43c9ddd57dae2feea941e7957  qtum-0.14.4-x86_64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\n    e394c256aa2674249f20c089a788d7ff4c9f686b39ea0b51f3dcf0456f949a7a  qtum-0.14.4-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\n    0767ef83a677aee4ecc63bcafe90b038fd75d6a0fbf09ebd91cc6c1beb2850a2  src/qtum-0.14.4.tar.gz\r\n    391918756fb4e04269c8bc3d3570e16bdc2eb4c4e8a7cf8c49d3509d3fad5b5e  qtum-linux-0.14-res.yml\r\n\r\n    79187553ee15aeedb6996edf7b27d4572cc76ce345c1c885939731bc2e38c009  qtum-0.14.4-win-unsigned.tar.gz\r\n    d96fc6cc7a335dd4b4c24af304f93b0b2677cc1b45a00804bcd752f6886c0b34  qtum-0.14.4-win32-debug.zip\r\n    ba5dd68eba70b665ad115641051f3da86c1bceb1ba94f76a45885c25d20aca2f  qtum-0.14.4-win32-setup-unsigned.exe\r\n    7da28419dfa8944e24bf0b8ed6053df6a320516ea8982e3af714ff37fe448860  qtum-0.14.4-win32.zip\r\n    bcc1d805758624251d24f35c382918f3ba7c3f2b4e38fca16414a42a9c81a777  qtum-0.14.4-win64-debug.zip\r\n    f867cec706d2f6ac8ff1e1e5047e4b19a245c90d501b779de2727b2806e022fc  qtum-0.14.4-win64-setup-unsigned.exe\r\n    efcfd2c7ffe61fb657c2aaa2a54d6bf5c9cd96a1318349cb2225e5a6c48d3409  qtum-0.14.4-win64.zip\r\n    f6888b883e02679363fbdeb5248f1cd1af5ded347f3f408171cc50bf5815ac6b  src/qtum-0.14.4.tar.gz\r\n    5792df3a3e8f183d9b9b04f71f1015a83abf6563276f806a7ad7f6c897919acf  qtum-win-0.14-res.yml\r\n\r\nIn addition, as of the time of this writing there is 0 false positives on the Windows 32bit and 64bit zip files, and 1 false positive on the Windows 32bit and 64bit installer files:\r\n\r\n    installer win32: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file-analysis/OWZhY2Y1OTk5MDk2MmZhMjZlZTFhMGZiMDljZmViZGY6MTUwODg1Nzk4OQ== 1 false positive that we've reported to Rising AV\r\n\r\n    installer win64 https://www.virustotal.com/#/file-analysis/NzFkNWEwY2EwMGVkNDc1ODJhMWViMjFhNWRjZWU3ZTQ6MTUwODg1ODEzMQ== 1 false positive (same as win32)\r\n\r\n    zip win32 https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/7da28419dfa8944e24bf0b8ed6053df6a320516ea8982e3af714ff37fe448860/detection 0 false positives\r\n\r\n    zip win64 https://www.virustotal.com/#/file-analysis/MGE1ZDU5MjQ4ZmM5NjI2NGNjMzNmYWY3NjIyZjk5YWQ6MTUwODg1ODE0Ng== 0 false positives\r\n\r\nYou can validate this message is from Earlz at https://keybase.io/verify\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: Keybase OpenPGP v2.0.76\r\nComment: https://keybase.io/crypto\r\n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\r\nLJYxm6pJzUAnF/qrV7XP\r\n=g54m\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n```\r\n",

                "name": "Mainnet Ignition v1.0.2",
                "description": "Qtum is a decentralized blockchain project built on Bitcoin's UTXO model, with support for Ethereum Virtual Machine based smart contracts, and secured by a proof of stake consensus model. It achieves this through the revolutionary Account Abstraction Layer which allows the EVM to communicate with Qtum's Bitcoin-like UTXO blockchain. For more general information about Qtum as well as links to join our community, go to https://qtum.org\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Qtum Ignition Main Network. This is the main network where the tokens hold value and should be guarded very carefully. There will be a testnet setup soon for developers, in the meantime you can use `-regtest` mode for testing needs. We will announce details about the token swap from QTUM ERC20 coins to QTUM mainnet tokens soon, watch our [website](https://qtum.org) for details about that.  \r\n\r\nThe major features implemented in Qtum Ignition include:\r\n\r\n1. The Ethereum Virtual Machine, which allows for compatibility with most existing Solidity based smart contracts.\r\n2. The Smart Staking Protocol is complete, which is an optimized Proof of Stake implementation designed for a smart contract platform (however, smart contracts can not participate in staking yet).\r\n3. An early and basic smart contract GUI has been implemented that can be used for creating contracts, sending data and Qtum to them, and checking their status by executing them locally. This functionality is similar to Mist's UI right now, but it is still an early version. We will be working on this more to improve it. \r\n4. Regtest mode, which is ideal for developers who wish to create their own private blockchain. It is tuned specifically to make development easier. It will stake blocks automatically every 30 seconds, and can generate proof-of-work blocks instantly as needed.\r\n5. The Decentralized Governance Protocol is completely implemented and functional, which allows certain network parameters to be modified without a fork.\r\n\r\nFor more technical information for how to start developing with Qtum please read the [Guide](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/blob/master/doc/sparknet-guide.md) and also see this tutorial for deploying a simple [faucet smart contract](http://earlz.net/view/2017/06/30/2144/the-qtum-sparknet-faucet) (it hasn't yet been updated for Mainnet for obvious reasons, but all the instructions are the same and you can try them in regtest mode)\r\n\r\nNote: Qtum Core is considered beta software. We make no warranties or guarantees of its security or stability.\r\n\r\nReindex Required When Upgrading from v1.0.1\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhen you first start the Qtum 1.0.2 GUI wallet after using Qtum v1.0.1 it will prompt you that it must reindex the database. This is normal and is a result of switching our internal database format from per-transaction to per-txout. If you use `qtumd -daemon` it will silently fail to start. You need to use `qtumd -daemon -reindex` in this case. \r\n\r\nDeleting the Sparknet and Skynet blockchain\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you downloaded the Sparknet or Skynet wallet and ran it at some point, then most likely you have a copy of the Sparknet or Skynet blockchain on your computer. There is no value in keeping this and it is safe to delete. You simply need to delete the data directory you chose when you first ran Qtum. If you're not sure, then it is probably in the default location. This location depends on platform:\r\n\r\n* On Linux: `~/.qtum`\r\n* On OSX: `~/Library/Application Support/Qtum`\r\n* On Windows: `%APPDATA%\\Qtum` (copy and paste this into your Explorer address bar and it'll take you there)\r\n\r\nIf you get an error about \"unknown genesis block\" or something similar, then this is the problem and you need to delete the old blockchain. Make sure to not delete the file `wallet.dat` if you have any mainnet Qtum tokens stored in an address within it. (It's recommended to keep it and then resync and make sure your coins are safe, just in case)\r\n\r\nQuickstart\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get started with Qtum is to simply download the binaries below.

                "description": "Qtum is a decentralized blockchain project built on Bitcoin's UTXO model, with support for Ethereum Virtual Machine based smart contracts, and secured by a proof of stake consensus model. It achieves this through the revolutionary Account Abstraction Layer which allows the EVM to communicate with Qtum's Bitcoin-like UTXO blockchain. For more general information about Qtum as well as links to join our community, go to https://qtum.org\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Qtum Ignition Main Network. This is the main network where the tokens hold value and should be guarded very carefully. There will be a testnet setup soon for developers, in the meantime you can use `-regtest` mode for testing needs. We will announce details about the token swap from QTUM ERC20 coins to QTUM mainnet tokens soon, watch our [website](https://qtum.org) for details about that.  \r\n\r\nThe major features implemented in Qtum Ignition include:\r\n\r\n1. The Ethereum Virtual Machine, which allows for compatibility with most existing Solidity based smart contracts.\r\n2. The Smart Staking Protocol is complete, which is an optimized Proof of Stake implementation designed for a smart contract platform (however, smart contracts can not participate in staking yet).\r\n3. An early and basic smart contract GUI has been implemented that can be used for creating contracts, sending data and Qtum to them, and checking their status by executing them locally. This functionality is similar to Mist's UI right now, but it is still an early version. We will be working on this more to improve it. \r\n4. Regtest mode, which is ideal for developers who wish to create their own private blockchain. It is tuned specifically to make development easier. It will stake blocks automatically every 30 seconds, and can generate proof-of-work blocks instantly as needed.\r\n5. The Decentralized Governance Protocol is completely implemented and functional, which allows certain network parameters to be modified without a fork.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more technical information for how to start developing with Qtum please read the [Guide](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/blob/master/doc/sparknet-guide.md) and also see this tutorial for deploying a simple [faucet smart contract](http://earlz.net/view/2017/06/30/2144/the-qtum-sparknet-faucet) (it hasn't yet been updated for Mainnet for obvious reasons, but all the instructions are the same and you can try them in regtest mode)\r\n\r\nDeleting the Sparknet and Skynet blockchain\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you downloaded the Sparknet or Skynet wallet and ran it at some point, then most likely you have a copy of the Sparknet or Skynet blockchain on your computer. There is no value in keeping this and it is safe to delete. You simply need to delete the data directory you chose when you first ran Qtum. If you're not sure, then it is probably in the default location. This location depends on platform:\r\n\r\n* On Linux: `~/.qtum`\r\n* On OSX: `~/Library/Application Support/Qtum`\r\n* On Windows: `%APPDATA%\\Qtum` (copy and paste this into your Explorer address bar and it'll take you there)\r\n\r\nIf you get an error about \"unknown genesis block\" or something similar, then this is the problem and you need to delete the old blockchain. Make sure to not delete the file `wallet.dat` if you have any mainnet Qtum tokens stored in an address within it. (It's recommended to keep it and then resync and make sure your coins are safe, just in case)\r\n\r\nQuickstart\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get started with Qtum is to simply download the binaries below.

Since our March 2017 crowd sale, we have delivered a working proof-of-concept, followed up by two test networks. The sheer amount of work invested in this project has been immense. To date, there have been contributions from over 20 developers, totalling over 60,000 man hours. We have always delivered on time, therefore, we would like to announce that the Qtum main network is officially complete. \r\n\r\nThis release includes a working Smart Contract and Decentralized Application platform, secured by a Proof-of-Stake consensus model. We have taken steps to ensure scalability is not a problem by introducing our Decentralized Governance Protocol. \r\n\r\nThis does not mean development will slow down, on the contrary, we will continue to test new features and expand on our impressive technology stack. Please remember, we aim to deliver a truly decentralized blockchain platform, not a centralized database.\r\n\r\nOver the next few weeks, we will explain how the ERC20 swap will take place. We ask that all Qtum holders safely store their tokens, and back up their private keys. We will contact exchanges and service providers and work with them to ensure that no one gets left behind during this swap process. We fully understand that people are busy, and cannot be on their computers every day, so we will make every effort to accommodate our community.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nThe Qtum Team ",

                "description": "Qtum is a decentralized blockchain project built on Bitcoin's UTXO model, but with support for Ethereum Virtual Machine based smart contracts. It achieves this through the revolutionary Account Abstraction Layer. For more general information about Qtum as well as links to join our community, go to https://qtum.org\r\n\r\nWelcome to Qtum Skynet, the second public testnet for the Qtum blockchain. The previous testnet was named Sparknet. The testnet is only for testing, as such, its tokens hold no value and production applications should not yet be created on the testnet blockchain. All tokens aqcuired during the testnet will cease to exist when the mainnet is released which actually has tokens which hold value. The purpose of the public testnet is to allow developers to begin testing and developing applications, allow early adopters to see a preview of how the network will behave, and for the Qtum development team to run several load tests which are not directly comparable when done on a private and controlled network. \r\n\r\nQtum Skynet will ideally have the same consensus features and parameters as the Qtum mainnet. We do not intend to add new consensus features during this period and the Skynet testnet should be a very realistic preview of how the mainnet network will function and behave. We will be added new non-consensus features such as new RPC commands, GUI features, and of course bug fixes and other things that make Qtum easier to use without modifying the blockchain protocol.\r\n\r\nThe major features and improvements implemented in Skynet include:\r\n\r\n1. The Decentralized Governance Protocol is completely implemented and functional\r\n2. The Smart Staking Protocol is complete to our specifications (Sparknet was missing a feature called MPoS which makes attacks more expensive to execute)\r\n3. A very early and basic smart contract GUI has been implemented that can be used for creating contracts, sending data and Qtum to them, and checking their status by executing them locally\r\n4. A great number of bug fixes and various improvements, including a bug fix to a performance problem which caused Sparknet nodes to sync extremely slowly as the blockchain grew larger\r\n5. All Solidity operations for smart contracts behave as expected now. The only compatibility break is contracts are not allowed to create contracts with an initial endowment of coins. The contract must first be created and then sent coins in a separate transaction.\r\n\r\nFor more technical information for how to start developing with Qtum Skynet please read the [Guide](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/blob/testnet-2/doc/sparknet-guide.md) and also see this tutorial for deploying a simple [faucet smart contract](http://earlz.net/view/2017/06/30/2144/the-qtum-sparknet-faucet) (it hasn't yet been updated for Skynet, but all the instructions are the same)\r\n\r\nUpgrading from Skynet v1.1 and below\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIn Skynet v1.2 a change was made which requires reindexing the blockchain. This can be done by using the command line argument `-reindex` when running either Qtumd or Qtum-Qt. Instructions for using command line arguments with a program:\r\n\r\n* [Windows](https://superuser.com/questions/747684/how-can-i-run-an-application-with-arguments-from-windows-explorer)\r\n* [OSX](https://superuser.com/a/116237)\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can also follow the instructions below to delete the blockchain (but keep the `wallet.dat` file if you received any testnet Qtum) which will also accomplish the chain being reindexed.\r\n\r\nDeleting the Sparknet blockchain\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you downloaded the Sparknet wallet and ran it at some point, then most likely you have a copy of the Sparknet blockchain on your computer. There is no value in keeping this and it is safe to delete. You simply need to delete the data directory you chose when you first ran Qtum. If you're not sure, then it is probably in the default location. This location depends on platform:\r\n\r\n* On Linux: `~/.qtum`\r\n* On OSX: `~/Library/Application Support/Qtum`\r\n* On Windows: `%APPDATA%\\Qtum` (copy and paste this into your Explorer address bar and it'll take you there)\r\n\r\nIf you get an error about \"unknown genesis block\" or something similar, then this is the problem and you need to delete the old blockchain.\r\n\r\nQuickstart\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get started with Qtum is to simply download the binaries below. To give a brief breakdown of the different versions available: \r\n\r\n#### Windows\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.2-win32.zip](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/testnet-skynet-v1.2/qtum-0.14.2-win32.zip) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 machines using Windows. If you have an older Windows computer and don't care about installing Qtum system-wide, then this is for you. \r\n* [qtum-0.14.2-win64.zip](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/testnet-skynet-v1.2/qtum-0.14.2-win64.zip) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using Windows. If you have a modern Windows computer and don't care about installing Qtum system-wide, then this is for you. \r\n* [qtum-0.14.2-win32-setup-unsigned.exe](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/testnet-skynet-v1.2/qtum-0.14.2-win32-setup-unsigned.exe) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 machines using Windows. This includes an installer and will install Qtum system wide. If you have an older Windows computer and want to install Qtum then this is for you.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.2-win64-setup-unsigned.exe](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/testnet-skynet-v1.2/qtum-0.14.2-win64-setup-unsigned.exe) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using Windows. This includes an installer and will install Qtum system wide. If you have a modern Windows computer and want to install Qtum then this is for you.\r\n\r\n#### OSX\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.2-osx64.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/testnet-skynet-v1.2/qtum-0.14.2-osx64.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using OSX. If you use a modern Mac and want development tools, this is what you want; we do not support older 32bit or PowerPC based Macs.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.2-osx-unsigned.dmg](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/testnet-skynet-v1.2/qtum-0.14.2-osx-unsigned.dmg) - A version of Qtum-Qt built for 64bit x86 machines using OSX in a .DMG installable format. If you use a modern Mac and aren't a developer, this is what you want; we do not support older 32bit or PowerPC based Macs.\r\n\r\n#### Linux\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.2-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/testnet-skynet-v1.2/qtum-0.14.2-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 PC platforms running Linux. This is probably what you want for older computers running Linux\r\n* [qtum-0.14.2-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/testnet-skynet-v1.2/qtum-0.14.2-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 PC platforms running Linux. This is probably what you want for any modern PC or server running Linux\r\n* [qtum-0.14.2-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/testnet-skynet-v1.2/qtum-0.14.2-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz) - A version of qtumd and qtum-cli built for 32bit ARM platforms using Linux. This includes the Raspberry Pi and many of it's clones\r\n* [qtum-0.14.2-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/testnet-skynet-v1.2/qtum-0.14.2-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of qtumd and qtum-cli built for 64bit ARM platforms using Linux\r\n\r\nBelow in the full list of binaries, there are also versions that include debug symbols. These are useful for developers, but will run slower and are significantly larger to download. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Build Qtum Core\r\n\r\nIf you want to build it from source, it's recommended to follow the specific [\"build\" documentation](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/tree/testnet-2/doc) for your platform. But mostly it boils down to the following:\r\n\r\n1. Clone the qtum source code and cd into `qtum`\r\n\r\n        git clone --recursive https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum.git\r\n        cd qtum\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Build qtum-core:\r\n\r\n    Configure and build the headless qtum binaries as well as the GUI (if Qt is found).\r\n\r\n    You can disable the GUI build by passing `--without-gui` to configure.\r\n\r\n        ./autogen.sh\r\n        ./configure\r\n        make\r\n\r\n3.  It is recommended to build and run the unit tests to ensure everything is working correctly:\r\n\r\n        make check\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you encounter an error like:\r\n\r\n> make[2]: *** No rule to make target \u2018cpp-ethereum/utils/libscrypt/b64.c\u2019, needed by \u2018cpp-ethereum/utils/libscrypt/libbitcoinconsensus_la-b64.lo\u2019.  Stop.\r\n\r\nThen you did not checkout the cpp-ethereum submodule for Qtum. To do that, simply:\r\n\r\n    cd qtum\r\n    git submodule update --init --recursive\r\n\r\n\r\nResources\r\n---------\r\n\r\nMake sure to check out these resources as well for more information and to keep up to date with all the latest news about Qtum. At least 1 developer is always around, so if you're developing on Qtum and need help, we'd love to welcome you to our community.  \r\n\r\n* [/r/Qtum on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/)\r\n* [Qtum.org](https://qtum.org/en/)\r\n* [Slack chat room](https://qtumslack.herokuapp.com/)\r\n* [@QtumOfficial on Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/qtumofficial)\r\n* [Qtum on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/QtumOfficial/)\r\n* [Qtum Forum](https://forum.qtum.org/)\r\n* Block explorer for Skynet (Coming soon!)\r\n* Faucet for Skynet (Coming soon!

                "description": "**Escrow**\r\n`rippled` 0.60.0 release includes **Escrow**, (previously called **SusPay**), which introduces a new ledger node type and several new transaction types to the Ripple network. Escrow permits users to cryptographically escrow XRP on RCL with an expiration date using a crypto-condition called preimage-sha-256, commonly referred to as a hashlock. An XRP Escrow transaction on RCL can be used together with Interledger, to allow a payment to be routed without having to trust third-party intermediaries. We believe this will open a range of possibilities and use cases for XRP, particularly when sending high value, low volume payments cross-border.\r\n\r\n**Payment Channels**\r\nThe amendment for Payment Channels was originally introduced in version 0.33.0, but is now ready for Payment Channels to be enabled on the production Ripple Consensus Ledger. XRP Payment Channels are intended for high volume, low value payments. They provide a method for scalable, intermittent, off-ledger settlement flowing in a single direction. For bidirectional payment channels, an XRP Payment Channel can be used in each direction. The recipient can claim any unpaid balance at any time before the channel closes. The owner can top off the channel as needed and must wait out a delay to close the channel to give the recipient a chance to supply any claims. The total amount paid increases monotonically as newer claims are issued.\r\n\r\n**Dynamic UNL Lite**\r\nAt the core of RCL is the consensus process. Through the consensus process, validating nodes agree on a specific subset of the candidate transactions to be considered for the next ledger. Consensus is an iterative process in which nodes relay proposals, or sets of candidate transactions. Nodes communicate and update proposals until a supermajority of peers agree on the same set of candidate transactions.\r\n\r\nDuring consensus, each node evaluates proposals from a specific set of peers, called chosen validators. Chosen validators represent a subset of the network which, when taken collectively, is \u201ctrusted\u201d not to collude in an attempt to defraud the node evaluating the proposals. This definition of \u201ctrust\u201d does not require that each individual chosen validator is trusted. Rather, validators are chosen based on the expectation they will not collude in a coordinated effort to falsify data relayed to the network.\r\n\r\nThe `rippled` 0.60.0 release introduces new Dynamic UNL configuration options, which allow `rippled` to update its set of trusted validators without reconfiguring and restarting. Instead of specifying a static list of trusted validators in the config or validators file, you can configure a trusted publisher key and a URI where the publisher serves signed lists of validators. `rippled` will regularly query the configured URIs for the latest recommended list of validators from the trusted publishers. Configuring the validation quorum is no longer required, as rippled will automatically update its quorum based on its current trusted validator set.\r\n\r\nDynamic UNL Lite is a progressive step towards fully automated dynamic UNLs, to which each client of the Ripple network determines its UNL through policies, rather than trusting a pre-provided list of validators.\r\n\r\n**fix1368 Amendment**\r\n`rippled` 0.60.0 also introduces the *fix1368* Amendment to fix a minor bug in transaction processing that causes some payments to fail when they should be valid. Specifically, during payment processing, some payment steps that are expected to produce a certain amount of currency may produce a microscopically different amount, due to a loss of precision related to floating-point number representation. When this occurs, those payments fail because they cannot deliver the exact amount intended. The fix1368 amendment corrects transaction processing so payments can no longer fail in this manner.\r\nThese features underline Ripple\u2019s continued support to improving RCL by making it more stable, distributed and scalable for settlement of global payments.\r\n\r\n## Upcoming Features\r\nWe do not have an update on the previously announced changes to the hash tree structure that rippled uses to represent a ledger, called SHAMapV2. At the time of activation, this amendment will require brief scheduled allowable unavailability while the changes to the hash tree structure are computed by the network. We will keep the community updated as we progress towards this date (TBA).\r\n\r\nYou can [update to the new version](https://ripple.com/build/rippled-setup/#updating-rippled) on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 or CentOS 7 using yum.

                "description": "The `rippled` 0.50.0 release includes **TickSize**, which allows gateways to set a \"tick size\" for assets they issue to to help promote faster price discovery and deeper liquidity, as well as reduce transaction spam and ledger churn on RCL. Ripple expects TickSize to be enabled via an Amendment called **TickSize** on Tuesday, 2017-02-21. This feature underlines Ripple\u2019s continued support to improving RCL and making it even better suited for settlement of global payments.\n\nYou can [update to the new version](https://ripple.com/build/rippled-setup/#updating-rippled) on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 or CentOS 7 using yum. For other platforms, please [compile the new version from source](https://wiki.ripple.com/Rippled_build_instructions).\n\n**New and Updated Features**\n\n**Problem & Solution**\n\nCurrently, offers on RCL can differ by as little as one part in a quadrillion. This means that there is essentially no value to placing an offer early, as an offer placed later at a microscopically better price gets priority over it. The **TickSize** Amendment solves this problem by introducing a minimum tick size that a price must move for an offer to be considered to be at a better price. The tick size is controlled by the issuers of the assets involved.\n\nWhen you place a buy offer, the amount of currency you will buy is respected. When you place a sell offer, the amount of currency you will sell is respected. If a tick size is in force, the other side of the offer will be rounded (in your favor) such that the ratio is rounded to the tick size before the offer is placed on the books.\n\n**TickSize** does not affect the size of an offer. A trader can still trade microscopic amounts of an asset. It just affects the prices (ratio of in to out) at which offers can be placed on the books. For asset pairs with XRP, the tick size imposed, if any, is the tick size of the issuer of the non-XRP asset. For asset pairs without XRP, the tick size imposed, if any, is the smaller of the two issuer's configured tick sizes.\n\nThe tick size is imposed by rounding the offer quality down to the nearest tick and recomputing the non-critical side of the offer. For a buy, the amount offered is rounded down. For a sell, the amount charged is rounded up.\n\n**Effects of TickSize Change**\n\nThis change lets issuers quantize the exchange rates of offers to use a specified number of significant digits. Gateways must enable a TickSize on their account for this feature to benefit them. A single AccountSet transaction may set a \"TickSize\" parameter. Legal values are 0 and 3-15 inclusive. Zero removes the setting. 3-15 allow that many decimal digits of precision in the pricing of offers for assets issued by this account. It will still be possible to place an offer to buy or sell any amount of an asset and the offer will still keep that amount as exactly as it does now. If an offer involves two assets that each have a tick size, the smaller number of significant figures (larger ticks) controls.\n\n**Benefits of TickSize Change**\n\nThe primary expected benefits of the TickSize amendment is the reduction of bots fighting over the tip of the order book, which means:\n- Quicker price discovery\n- Traders can't be outbid by a microscopic amount\n- More offers left on the books\n- A reduction in offer creation and cancellation spam\n\nWe also expect larger tick sizes to benefit market makers in the following ways:\n- They increase the delta between the fair market value and the trade price, ultimately reducing spreads\n- They prevent market makers from consuming each other's offers due to slight changes in perceived fair market value, which promotes liquidity\n- They promote faster price discovery since traders have to adjust their prices in financially distinct increments\n- They reduce transaction spam by reducing fighting over the tip of the order book and reducing the need to change offers due to slight price changes\n- They reduce ledger churn and metadata sizes by reducing the number of indexes each order book must have\n- They allow the order book as presented to traders to better reflect the actual book since these presentations are inevitably aggregated into ticks\n\n**Hardened TLS configuration**\n\nThis release updates the default TLS configuration for `rippled`. The new release supports only 2048-bit DH parameters and defines a new default set of modern ciphers to use, removing support for ciphers and hash functions that are no longer considered secure.\n\nServer administrators who wish to have different settings can configure custom global and per-port cipher suites in the configuration file using the ssl_ciphers directive.\n\n## 0.50.0 Change Log\n- Remove websocketpp support [(#1910)](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/1910)\n- Increase OpenSSL requirements & harden default TLS cipher suites [(#1913)](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/1913)\n- Move test support sources out of ripple directory [(#1916)](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/1916)\n- Enhance ledger header RPC commands [(#1918)](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/1918)\n- Add support for tick sizes [(#1922)](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/1922)\n- Port discrepancy-test.coffee to c++ [(#1930)](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/1930)\n- Remove redundant call to clearNeedNetworkLedger [(#1931)](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/1931)\n- Port freeze-test.coffee to C++ unit test.

The first 25% of the distribution is\r\n  spendable. After that 25% is spent, a timestamp will be added to the code to\r\n  enable further distribution.\r\n- Add `/coinSupply` endpoint. Correctly returns total, locked and unlocked coin\r\n  amounts.\r\n- `testutil` package for common test setup methods.\r\n- `/version` endpoint, which will return the current node version number and\r\n  the HEAD commit id when build the node\r\n- `-no-ping-log` option to disable ping/pong log output\r\n- Check for invalid block signatures during startup and recreate the database\r\n  if they are corrupted.\r\n- Add methods for converting fixed-point decimal strings to droplets and\r\n  vice versa.\r\n- Add `make run`, `make test`, `make lint`, `make check` to `Makefile`\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n- Flag peers as incoming or outgoing.\r\n- Refactor to decouple `wallet` and `visor` package.\r\n- Refactor `cli` package for use as a library.\r\n- `README` improvements.\r\n- Set default wallet's label as \"Your Wallet\"\r\n- Use BIP32 mnemomic seeds by default in `address_gen`.\r\n- Add `-x` option to `address_gen`, to generate a random base64-encoded 128-bit\r\n  seed instead of a BIP32 mnemomic seed.\r\n- Add `-v` option to `address_gen` to print all address information\r\n  (pubkey, seckey, address, seed) to stdout as JSON.\r\n- All API and CLI methods with \"coin\"-related arguments must be a string and\r\n  can use decimal notation to specify coin amounts.\r\n- CLI's `walletHistory` command prints amounts as fixed-point decimal strings.\r\n  Previously, it printed amounts as integers representing whole skycoin amounts,\r\n  and did not support droplets / fractional skycoins.\r\n- A user is prevented from broadcasting a new transaction with unspent outputs\r\n  that they have already sent as an unconfirmed transaction.\r\n\r\n### Deprecated\r\n\r\n- `/api/getEffectiveOutputs` is deprecated in favor of `/coinSupply`.\r\n\r\n### Removed\r\n\r\n- Old wallet\r\n- `/api/create-address` endpoint (use the `address_gen` tool)\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n\r\n- Wallet folder path loading.\r\n- #371 Fix `/wallet/spend`, will return only when pending transaction is\r\n  confirmed.\r\n- #443 Fix predicted balance in `/wallet/spend` API call.\r\n- #444 Fix bug in `/blockchain/progress` API call.\r\n- Removed globals in `gui` package that caused race condition with wallet API\r\n  calls.\r\n- #494 Clean invalid unconfirmed transactions during startup.\r\n- Various race conditions around the bolt.DB blockchain DB\r\n- Missing `strand()` call in `daemon.Visor.AnnounceTxns`.\r\n",

It is recommended you run stellar-core with these set to \"true\" until the load of the checks becomes an issue.\r\n- more extensive tests\r\n- add --base64 command line option\r\n- add --priv2pub command line option\r\n\r\n# Fixes\r\n- hide database password from log\r\n- fixed several issues with how account data was cached for multiple operations during a single transaction\r\n- fix multiple merge issue that could generate lumens\r\n- fix issues with path payment that could destroy lumens\r\n- fix inflation bug that would calculate the wrong amount under rare circumstances \r\n",

First you must delete any existing Syscoin 2.0 service data. Locate your data dir on windows or Mac/OSX and delete all files except for wallet.dat.\n2. Start Syscoin 2.1 and wait for it to sync.\n\n## Other Release Notes\n\nBecause of the extent of the updates introduced, specifically to maximize blockchain pruning, all existing Syscoin services will be removed upon release of Syscoin 2.1. \n\n## Syscoin 2.1.0 New Features\n- **Blockchain Pruning** \u2013 Provides improved scalability to the core syscoin blockchain by efficiently pruning expired service data to minimize blockchain bloat for full nodes.\n- **Unique Aliases / Syscoin Identities** \u2013 Syscoin Aliases are now unique across the network; a change from Syscoin 2.0 where variable-case aliases were permitted.\n- **Alias Portability** \u2013 Optional passwords attached to aliases provide for portability and restoration options not possible on Syscoin 2.0 including the ability to recover an account simply by using the related Alias password.\n- **Marketplace Moderation** \u2013 Two tiers of marketplace moderation both user-defined via SafeSearch and team-defined via a 3 tier system. The moderation system allows for a more public-friendly marketplace with options for SafeSearch restricted items.\n- **Private payments via ZCash** \u2013 Syscoin users can now leverage ZEC as a direct payment option, which natively includes enhanced privacy.\n- **Multiple payment options** \u2013 Offers can now be paid for in any currency supported by the marketplace and supported by the merchants. Rather than one specific currency, payments can be now be made using all three supported blockchains (SYS, BTC and ZEC).\n- **Multi-signature Transaction Support across all Syscoin services** \u2013 Aliases, Certificates and Offers, now support multi-signature transactions, enabling a whole new class of use cases for Syscoin services.\n- **Bitcoin 0.13 Core Update** \u2013 As outlined in the launch of Syscoin 2.0, the importance of keeping up-to-date with the latest bitcoin technology is essential for Syscoin to thrive; thus, we planned on keeping up to date with the latest Bitcoin core. Keeping up-to-date will be accomplished by upgrading the Syscoin 2.1 update to Bitcoin\u2019s latest core 0.13.99.\n- **Escrow Support on External Payments** \u2013 Escrow was previously only available on offers purchased using Syscoin. With Syscoin 2.1, Escrow will now be available on offers purchased with any currency accepted, SYS, BTC or ZEC.\n- **Private Alias Data** \u2013 Aliases now include a private field which is visible only to the owner of the alias, allowing for private data storage on the blockchain.\n- **Default Settings** \u2013 There is now support for default Alias and default price-peg selection, increasing wallet usability. All service screens now also include the option to view all services the wallet owns or view services by individual Alias.\n- **Dynamic Fees** \u2013 Fee information is now stored in the Alias rates peg allowing for dynamic fees specifically for Syscoin services. This enables different fee structures with different pegs and gives merchants more flexibility in pricing.\n- **Shipping Notification System** \u2013 Optionally allows merchants to notify customers that an item has been shipped.\n- **Feedback and Rating System** \u2013 A 5-star feedback and rating system can now be provided for Merchants, Customers and Arbitrators, ensuring an accurate representation of reputation history for all parties.\n  Easy unlock for encrypted wallets \u2013 Easy unlock mechanism for improved usability w/encrypted wallets.\n- **Hide Sold Out/Expired Offers** \u2013 Hide items that have are sold out or expired from wallet listing screens.\n- **Search within category** \u2013 Search within a specific category rather than always searching all categories.\n- **Suggested categories** \u2013 A standardized set of categories across the Syscoin marketplace, or use your own.\n- **Offer geolocation** \u2013 Optionally add geolocation to offers.\n- **General Bug Fixes and Improvements**\n",

This update is in response to two large unknown miners blocking SegWit activation on the Vertcoin network (https://vtconline.org/sf.html) despite >95% of nodes being upgraded and a clear desire from the community to upgrade. \r\n\r\nSince over 50% of the network hashrate belongs to the \"attackers\", they will likely not update and not implement UASF, so this update should be treated in the same way as a Hard Fork. Old wallets will continue to follow whichever chain has the most work, and will only reorg to the SegWit chain once it has more work behind it. Thus, any fork will be temporary, but will likely exist for some time. Therefore, *everyone* should upgrade to this new wallet to ensure the stability of the network and reduce the risk of a fork.",

Thus, it soft forks BIP34, 66, 65, CSV and SegWit into Vertcoin as well as the other BIPs included in Bitcoin Core since v0.8. The soft forks will start signalling compliance from block 675,360 and will continue to signal for a year. Once 75% of blocks over a 2016 block period have signalled, after another 2016 block period the soft forks will activate and old version blocks will be orphaned from that point on. **Therefore it is highly recommended you upgrade your wallet and this update should be treated as mandatory.** It is especially important that pools upgrade as we need at least 75% of blocks mined to be upgraded in order to activate the soft forks. Pools that do not upgrade could risk orphaned blocks after activation. Everyone else, including users and exchanges, should upgrade too to guard against forking after activation. \n\n**Remember to backup your wallet.dat before you upgrade your wallet. Failing to do so could result in the loss of all your coins.**\n\nMiners themselves will not have to do anything, but pool operators will need to upgrade their pool software to be compatible with the new wallet. We have a version of stratum-mining that is confirmed working. An upgraded p2pool version is in development and should be released soon.\n\nstratum-mining: https://github.com/Crypto-Expert/stratum-mining\n\nDevelopment Fund Donation Address: VpBsRnN749jYHE9hT8dZreznHfmFMdE1yG\n",

We added ``z_shieldcoinbase`` as an experimental feature. (#2615)\r\n2. We changed the ``importprivkey`` RPC method to return the public address corresponding to the imported key. (#2616)\r\n3. We fixed build issues encountered when using GCC 7. (#2545)\r\n4. We added support for fetching the public network parameters from IPFS.

You should update as soon as possible if you are using a previous release. This release only partially mitigates against transaction replay attacks until the ZenCash network passes Block 117,575. It is recommended NOT to attempt to reclaim ZEN balances from ZCL wallet files and if possible to refrain from moving around ZEN until we pass Block 117,575. After the Soft Fork activates these wallets will be safe to use to conduct transactions and to reclaim ZEN from ZCL wallet files.\r\n\r\nPlease keep yourself informed about new releases via [Slack](https://slackinvite.zensystem.io/) or our [Blog](https://blog.zensystem.io/) \r\n\r\n```\r\nDebian package (Depends: libc6 (>= 2.17), libgcc1 (>= 1:3.0), libgomp1 (>= 4.9), libstdc++6 (>= 5.2))\r\n\r\nsha256sum f009270e9f18062724ca925d57ccc571e854acfc01856eb3ba6148b28862c9d9  zen-2.0.9-2-b4315d9-amd64.deb\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe MacOS binaries are not signed with an Apple developer certificate.
