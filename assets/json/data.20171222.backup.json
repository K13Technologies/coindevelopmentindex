Forked blocks are disregarded.\n\nMore to come stay tuned\n",

                "description": "After the hardfork release (`2.0.171105a`) and hardfork date (2017-12-08) passed, the BitShares Core dev team has enough updates for a new release. This release targets API nodes and we recommend them to upgrade. Block producers (witnesses) and seed nodes should keep in the hardfork release (`2.0.171105a`) until we can confirm the new release is stable enough.\r\n\r\nThe most notorious changes are in the addition and update of plugins and some general fixes. No consensus changes are present in this release and the upgrade is recommended to API nodes but optional.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* New ElasticSearch plugin. Pull request: https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-core/pull/444 - Allows to run full nodes with reduced RAM while it adds more robust querying into account history.

It's optional for witnesses, seed nodes and other users.\r\n\r\n**NOTE: It's REQUIRED to run a NTP daemon on the same server which will mitigate several issues.**\r\n\r\n## New features and changes\r\n* Added a `max-ops-per-account` option to `account_history` plugin, when set, only at most that number of history entries per account will be kept in memory. Set it to `0` to store no history. Set it to a big number to keep all history. If `partial-operations` option is set to `true` at the same time, old `operation_history_object` data (1.11.x) will be removed from memory as well, which will save a lot of RAM. Changing of these parameters need a replay to take effect.\r\n\r\n  This is recommended for public API service providers. Set these options in `config.ini`, then restart `witness_node` with `--replay-blockchain`:\r\n  ```\r\n  max-ops-per-account = 1000\r\n  partial-operations = true\r\n  ```\r\n* Added a `removed_ops` field to `account_statistics_object` to track number of entries removed; behavior of `total_ops` field didn't change.\r\n* Fixed Windows build.\r\n\r\n## Known issues\r\n* `get_relative_account_history` command / API in `cli_wallet` may return incorrect data when `limit` is greater than `100` and `start` is too big. (see #298)\r\n* As of writing, the Windows binaries attached to this release are built without `readline` support, so `cli_wallet.exe` lack of some features, for example tab completion and Ctrl-D termination. \r\n\r\n## Other notes\r\n* Future GUI releases will be published under https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-ui/releases only.\r\n* SHA256 checksum of attached binary `BitShares-Core-2.0.170606-x64-cli-tools.zip` is `0a96598b1020daca5987558bfc998f3663c7e4188cdf0a1abac779253ac33635`\r\n",

                "description": "This release contains several security fixes, as well as new features that improve performance.\r\n\r\n* **All Ubuntu nodes are recommended to upgrade to this release.** Untested under other Operating Systems so far.\r\n* It's **REQUIRED** to run a NTP daemon on the same server which will mitigate several issues.\r\n\r\n## New features and changes\r\n* Added a `partial-operations` option to `account_history` plugin. RAM requirement is significantly reduced when this option is used with `track-account` option combined. Highly recommended for Witness nodes, seed nodes, Exchanges and other node operators which don't need to watch account history or only need to watch histories of a small set of accounts. (#289)\r\n  For Example, the OpenLedger.io exchange can use this config (for deposit processing, but not for API servers):\r\n  ```\r\n  track-account = \"1.2.96393\"\r\n  track-account = \"1.2.96397\"\r\n  partial-operations = true\r\n  ```\r\n* Added a `get_relative_account_history` command / API to CLI wallet. Very useful for accounts with large quantity of histories. (#277)\r\n* Added `get_block_header_batch` database API (#262)\r\n* Added `get_account_history_operations` node API for account_history plugin (#237)\r\n* Added new API sets: `asset_api` and `block_api` (#224, #225, #226)\r\n* Added `is_public_key_registered` database API and CLI command / API, added `derive_owner_keys_from_brain_key` CLI command / API (#235)\r\n* `get_full_accounts` API now returns force settlement orders, withdraw permissions and list of owned assets (#261, #232, #229)\r\n* `get_market_history` CLI command / API now returns the most recent data (#242)\r\n* When calling an API method, now it's able to specify the API-identifier by the name directly, rather than a number.(https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-fc/pull/2, more info in #223)\r\n* Clients now will be authenticated implicitly on the server side if a correct HTTP Authorization request header is present when connected. This means API's those require `login` now can be accessed via HTTP directly as well as WebSocket without an explicit `login` call. (#223, https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-fc/pull/1)\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n* Additional console log for already in use p2p port (#264)\r\n* Web socket now pushes less data by default. (#249)\r\n* Removed log of private keys in witness start (#236)\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n* Fixed an issue that may cause the network to stale when a witness is misbehaving (#17)\r\n* Fixed an issue that may cause double spending when a witness is misbehaving\r\n* Fixed an issue that causes seed nodes to stop responding to new connections\r\n* Fixed a crash caused by DNS issues when the node is starting (#18)\r\n* Fixed a crash when the node is starting (#274)\r\n* Fixed a crash in get_ticker and get_24_volume API (#250, #255)\r\n* Fixed a memory leak issue (#257)\r\n* Fixed `track-account` option of account history plugin (#259)\r\n* Fixed several issues found in `get_relative_account_history` node API (#280, #281)\r\n\r\n## Other changes\r\n* Updated default seed node list\r\n\r\n## Other notes\r\n* Future GUI releases will be published under https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-ui/releases only.\r\n",

This means in terms of the code-base we introduced all the changes between Bitcoin 0.9 and 0.11 into this version of Dogecoin Core.  \nWe therefore suggest to read the release notes of both [Bitcoin 0.10](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.10.0.md) and [Bitcoin 0.11](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.11.0/doc/release-notes.md). 1.10 is a recommended update for all users, and if you cannot update to 1.10 for whatever reason, you must update to 1.8.3 which is a critical security fix to 1.8.2. \n\n# Upgrading\n\nTo upgrade from any version below 1.10 you will need to re-index once, as the block database format has changed. If you run the Qt GUI client, it will prompt you to do so on the first start after the update. If you run a dogecoind daemon, you will need to start it with the parameter `-reindex` once after you updated. This process can take a few hours, depending on the performance of your machine.\n\nIMPORTANT: During reindex transactions will be \"replayed\" by the wallet as they're indexed, meaning that your balance will not necessarily be accurate until the end of the reindex process. Do not send transactions during reindex, as this may result in conflicted transactions once the reindex is complete.\n\n# Notable changes\n\nFor further explanation of these, see the above mentioned Bitcoin release notes.\n\n## Faster synchronization\n\nDogecoin Core 1.10 introduces headers-first and parallel block synchronization to greatly reduce the initial blockchain synchronization time.\n\n## Watch only address support\n\nIt is now possible to add public keys to your wallet that will be held in a \"watch only\" state. This means you will get information about incoming/outgoing transactions and resulting balance changes. Especially useful to keep track of your paper wallets.\n\n## Strict signature encoding (BIP66)\n\nThis release activates [BIP66](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0066.mediawiki) which enforces strict rules about how transaction signatures are encoded and therefore will introduce a new block version (3). These rules will only activate once a certain number of blocks are mined with this new version. NOTE: This is **not** a hard fork, as all existing wallets will accept version 3 blocks, although they'll fail to enforce the new requirements.\n\n## Block file pruning\n\nIt is possible to run a Dogecoin node without keeping the full blockchain on your disk. This is currently incompatible with having a wallet on that client due to the fact that some actions regarding a wallet require the full block data. The minimum amount of kept blocks has been changed from Bitcoin to reflect our shorter block times.  \n\n## General comments\n\nPlease backup your wallet regularly and especially before performing this upgrade. Do not copy your wallet.dat while Dogecoin Core is open. Instead you should either use the backup feature you find in the \"File\" menu or shut down Dogecoin Core completely before you make a copy of your wallet.dat.  \n",

Dogecoin Core 1.8.1 also adds in support for printing\npaper wallets, and disables connections to pre-1.8 clients. This is a RECOMMENDED\nupgrade due to the large number of bug fixes, but is not a required one.\n\nPaper wallet support has been developed by AndyMeows (IRC username), and \ncan be accessed via the \"File\" menu. It's intended for two purposes; to generate\nsmall value paper wallets to hand out, and more permanent deposit paper wallets\nfor keeping balances offline.\n\nIMPORTANT: If you are producing offline paper wallets, you should do so on a\ncomputer that's disconnected from the Internet. While the wallet generator\ndoes not save the keys it generates, this ensures there is no risk of a virus\nor similar capturing the key from memory or interfering with its generation.\n\n## Dogecoin Core Release Notes\n- Translation improvements and corrections\n- Disable Transifex based translation process (not used by Dogecoin Core)\n- Add checkpoints around AuxPoW switchover block (371,337)\n- Disable connections from pre-1.8 Dogecoin Core clients\n- Use HTTPS with dogechain.info\n- Remove unreachable code introduced with AuxPoW support\n- \"blocknotify\" option now supports %i as a format parameter, which is replaced by block height\n- New option \"maxoutconnections\" to set the maximum number of outbound peer connections. Defaults to 8, minimum is 2, maximum is whatever \"maxconnections\" is set to (default 125).\n\n## Bitcoin Core Release Notes\n\nFull release notes for Bitcoin Core 0.9.3 are available from\nhttps://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.9.3 , but highlights are included\nbelow:\n- Better orphan transaction handling\n- Add -maxorphantx=<n> and -maxorphanblocks=<n> options for control over the maximum orphan transactions and blocks\n- key.cpp: fail with a friendlier message on missing ssl EC support\n- Upgrade OpenSSL to 1.0.1i (see https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140806.txt - just to be sure, no critical issues for Bitcoin Core)\n\n## Known Issues\n\nThere is a known issue with quantities in JSON used by the RPC interface (https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/issues/134).\nThis stems from the use of a floating point precision number to hold fixed precision data.\nCurrently looking at solutions, which primarily either involve JSON which is not compliant\nto the specification, or making the RPC layer slightly incompatible with the conventional\nBitcoin API.\n\nThis only affects values significantly below 1 Doge, however merchants may wish to round to\nthe nearest Doge on all transactions for now.\n\n## Credits\n\nListed in strictly alphabetical order, using name listed in Github.

These releases are focused on providing developer APIs and a productive developer environment.\r\n\r\n# Table of Contents\r\n1.

[Differences Between Public and Private Testnets](#testnetdiffs)\r\n1. [Known Open Issues](#issues)\r\n    * [Benchmarking](#benchmarking)\r\n1. [Disclaimer](#disclaimer)\r\n\r\n<a name=\"who\"></a>\r\n# Who This Release is For\r\nWhether you are an experienced C++ developer interested in blockchain or a seasoned blockchain expert, you are welcome to experiment with this second pre-release. Familiarity with Linux/C++ is highly recommended. Experience with smart contracts is not a prerequisite -- you'll get that here.\r\n\r\nIf you are unfamiliar with both Linux and C++, please wait for a more end-user friendly release. The current release is for experienced developers. \r\n\r\n<a name=\"config\"></a>\r\n## Minimum Configuration\r\nCurrently EOS.IO has been tested on Ubuntu 16.10  and Mac OS Sierra. EOS.IO nodes run well on a minimum hardware requirement of Core i7 CPU, 16GB RAM. Some users have reported success with 8GB RAM, but this configuration is not supported at this time.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"included\"></a>\r\n# Features Included in this Release\r\n\r\nNote that, as of this release, we are evolving away from the previously released Roadmap. We expect to publish a revised roadmap in Q4, 2017.\r\n\r\n## General Features\r\n* Configurable block time (previously hard coded at 3 seconds)\r\n* P2P code hardened with improved node sync\r\n* Developer API with standardized coding style\r\n* Wallet to set up and maintain accounts that use the API\r\n* Contract Security and Authorization\r\n* Simple Rate and Database Limiting\r\n* Github repository with tutorials, code, documentation and sample Smart Contracts\r\n* Single-threaded, so expect between 500 to 1000 Transactions Per Second (TPS) on private testnets and standalone deployments\r\n\r\n## Features Unique to the Public Testnet \r\n* Two (2) second block time\r\n* Simulates the eventual EOS Production environment that will be available mid-2018\r\n* 21 block-producing nodes, 1 per host\r\n* Genesis block for registered EOS token holders\r\n  * Developers who do not have tokens in the Genesis block can request them via our Faucet facility. Contact Developer Support via Telegram for further instructions. \r\n* For the 04-Dec-2017 Public Testnet launch, performance is throttled down to 30 transactions per second. This is because there are known attack vectors for which we have unimplemented solutions. For example, compilation of new contracts for the first time can take up to 34ms, which if exploited could cause the network to fragment at transaction rates over 30 TPS. When the solution is implemented this restriction is expected to be lifted for at least some operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Programs\r\n* A standalone node **eosd** that produces blocks and adds them to the blockchain\r\n* A client **eosc** that provides a command line interface\r\n* **eos-walletd** provides a client-side local wallet server\r\n* A **launcher** that configures and optionally starts a local or distributed multi-node testnet \r\n* \r\n## Scripts\r\n* **build.sh** to install dependencies and build eos\r\n* **eoscpp** for smart contract developers to build contracts\r\n* \r\n## Example Contracts\r\n* Native contracts,\r\n   * native currency\r\n   * staking \r\n   * producer voting \r\n   * code updating \r\n   * permission updating\r\n* Example contracts\r\n   * dice\r\n   * exchange\r\n   * simpledb\r\n   * social \r\n## Documentation\r\n* Virtual machine API\r\n   * deferred / inline messaging \r\n   * user-local storage for contracts\r\n   * 3 built in database types\r\n* Basic developer documentation (at [https://eosio.github.io/eos/](https://eosio.github.io/eos/))\r\n   * installation and setup \r\n   * build and deployment\r\n   * tutorials for blockchain commands\r\n   * Doxygen based API reference\r\n\r\n## Utilities and Other Features\r\n### Genesis Block Generator\r\n* We have a tool in pre-release that allows for generation of a custom genesis.json file, i.e. a Genesis Block, that includes our Genesis Snapshot of ERC20 tokens already registered. This tool is not yet supported and you use it at your own risk. Access it at [https://eosio.github.io/genesis/](https://eosio.github.io/genesis/)\r\n\r\n\r\n<a name=\"notincluded\"></a>\r\n## Features Not Included in this Release\r\nNot included in this release are:\r\n\r\n* Advanced resource usage and rate limiting\r\n* Inter-blockchain communication\r\n* Hacked account recovery\r\n* These native contracts:\r\n  * producer proxy voting\r\n  * EOS.IO Storage \r\n  * feature upgrade voting (hard forks)\r\n  * stake delegation (renting and leasing tokens)\r\n\r\n\r\n<a name=\"testnetdiffs\"></a>\r\n# Differences Between Public and Private Testnets\r\n\r\n## No producer voting in Public Testnet\r\nThe public testnet has had producer voting disabled. You can enable this on your private testnet with minor code changes -- look at the tags prior to 01-Dec-2017 for the non-disabled code. \r\n\r\n## Throttling of Public Testnet\r\nAs noted above, at time of release the public testnet is being rate-limited to 30 transactions per second. Private testnets will not be limited in this fashion. This is a configuration setting and code downloaded from GitHub will be unthrottled.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"issues\"></a>\r\n# Known Open Issues \r\n## Multi-Signature Wallet #867\r\nMulti-sig wallets will not behave correctly in some cases\r\n\r\n## MongoDB \r\nAt the time of release, mongodb was not up yet on the Testnet; this may change very quickly so check in with developer support via the EOS Developer channel on Telegram\r\n\r\n## Connection to Testnet via `eosd` #864\r\n`eosc` can connect, but `eosd` cannot connect to the Testnet yet\r\n\r\n## max-clients setting #865\r\nMax-clients parameter is for external `eosd` connections and is currently limited to 25; it must be a larger number to support significant numbers of external `eosd`s connecting to the Testnet\r\n\r\n## Genesis file generator #861\r\n* The genesis file generator at https://eosio.github.io/genesis/ omits \" EOS\" in the liquid balance of new accounts it adds.\r\n* The \"initial_timestamp\" is set for a time in the future rather than the current time.\r\n* The \"initial_parameters\" should have numeric values that are UNQUOTED but they are in fact double-quoted.\r\n\r\n## Launcher creates empty config.ini #842\r\nIn some circumstances the launcher generates a config.ini that is empty.\r\n\r\n## Other open issues\r\nA list of open issues can be found here:\r\n* https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues\r\n\r\n<a name=\"benchmarking\"></a>\r\n## Benchmarking \r\n\r\nWe have tools that have enabled us to benchmark the code at over 10,000 TPS per second under certain controlled conditions, but it remains too early for anyone to reliably reproduce benchmarks and/or interpret the results for a number of reasons:\r\n\r\n- you must operate a multi-node network and push transactions to multiple different nodes\r\n- block production algorithm does not currently time-bound generation which means benchmarks do not properly capture \"backlog\" or generation bottlenecks\r\n- the HTTP interface is currently a bottleneck in submitting transactions to the network\r\n- the signature verification is not yet multi-threaded \r\n\r\nThis release is designed to help developers build their applications. It does not provide a robust performance benchmarking toolkit. \r\n\r\nThose wishing to attempt their own benchmarking, or who wish to generate traffic on their private testnets for other reasons, may choose to look at the code underlying the `eosc benchmark transfer` command, which serves as an example. It was developed internally to simulate user traffic.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"disclaimer\"></a>\r\n# Disclaimer\r\n*block.one is a software company and is producing the EOS.IO software as free, open source software.

The release also contains a few developer niceties. **Please see compatibility section below!**\r\n\r\n**New features:**\r\n\r\n * Roll out v2 of the `les` light client protocol (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14970, https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15367, https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15391).\r\n * Insta-mining, zero CPU, clique based PoA developer mode `--dev` (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15323).\r\n * Add API endpoint to list modified accounts between two blocks (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15512).\r\n * Gas estimation returns error instead of maxgas if transaction cannot be executed (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15477).\r\n * Improve EVM jump destination analysis for worst case scenarios (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14582).\r\n * Enforce `application/json` for HTTP RPC requests (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15220, https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15496).\r\n * Private network faucet support Facebook, Twitter and Google+ authentication (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15313).\r\n * Support encrypted SSH keys in the Puppeth network manager (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15443).\r\n * Introduce docker images containing all Ethereum tools (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15467).\r\n * Start shipping Ubuntu Artful Aardvark launchpad packages (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15344).\r\n\r\n**Squashed bugs:**\r\n\r\n * Fix log filtering when specifying non-8-multiple starting block number (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15489).\r\n * Fix replacement transaction propagation (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15343).\r\n * Reduce disk overhead on keystore startup (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15526, https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15527, https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15529).\r\n * Fix occasional Rinkeby chain split by additional fork selection logic (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15470).\r\n * Fix JavaScript tracing to permit working with `Address` types (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15297).\r\n * Fix missing commit hash in docker image versions (https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15458, https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15464).\r\n\r\n**Compatibility caveats:**\r\n\r\n * All HTTP RPC requests from now on need to have the `Content-Type: application/json` header set on them. Geth v1.7.3 will **refuse** to service requests with no content type headers set (or headers with different content types). This is a security measure to counter a browser CORS circumvention technique.\r\n * Geth v1.7.3 ships with `les/2` light client support, which might have harder time finding light servers initially until the server providers upgrade to v1.7.3 too.\r\n\r\nFor a full rundown of changes, please see the [v1.7.3](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/milestone/59?closed=1) milestone.\r\n\r\n**As always, binaries and mobile libraries are available on our [download page](https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/)**.",

                "description": "The Go Ethereum team is proud to announce the next release family of Geth, the first incarnation of which focuses on laying the groundwork for the upcoming Metropolis hard forks (Byzantium and Constantinople) and consists of [125+ code contributions](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/milestone/47?closed=1) to various parts of the project.\r\n\r\n## Byzantium fork\r\n\r\nThe current incarnation of Geth contains all the Byzantium EIPs implemented and also features the fork block number **1,700,000** for the Ropsten testnet transition. The block numbers for Rinkeby and the main Ethereum network will be finalized when Ropsten is deemed stable.\r\n\r\nYou can find details about individual protocol updates at the following locations:\r\n\r\n* **[EIP 98](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/98)**: Removal of intermediate state roots from receipts ([#14750](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14750)).\r\n* Expanded by **[EIP 658](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/658)**: Embedding transaction return data in receipts ([#15014](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15014)).\r\n* **[EIP 100](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/100)**: Change difficulty adjustment to target mean block time including uncles ([#14733](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14733)).\r\n* **[EIP 198](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/198)**, **[EIP 212 (197)](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/212)** and **[EIP 213 (196)](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/213)**: Precompiled contracts for modular exponentiation; elliptic curve addition, scalar multiplication and pairing ([#14959](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14959), [#14993](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14993)).\r\n* **[EIP 214 (116)](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/214)**: Expanding the EVM with static contract calls ([#14978](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14978)).\r\n* **[EIP 211](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/211)**: Expanding the EVM with dynamically sized return data ([#14981](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14981)).\r\n* **[EIP 206 (140)](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/206)**: Expanding the EVM with cheap state revertals ([#14983](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14983)).\r\n* **[EIP 649](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/669)**: Delaying the difficulty bomb and reducing the block reward ([#15028](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15028)).\r\n* **[EIP 684](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/684)**: Preventing overwriting contracts (Byzantium prep) ([#15039](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15039)).\r\n\r\n## Performance optimizations\r\n\r\nThe 1.7 release series of Geth is aimed to focus primarily on performance improvements (beside the Byzantium hard fork). The first release of the family already packs a heavy punch with two database schema modifications resulting in significant optimizations:\r\n\r\n* Transaction and receipt storage was completely reworked, cutting the data storage requirements of a fast synced node in half, from 26.3GB to 14.9GB at the time of the implementation ([#14801](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14801)).\r\n* EVM log storage and indexing was completely reworked, cutting the filtering time of the entire chain for contract events by 2-3 orders of magnitude, from minutes to under a second ([#14522](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14522), [#14631](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14631)).\r\n\r\nSome work-in-progress updates that will land in the next releases are:\r\n\r\n* Upgrading the base peer-to-peer protocol used by all Ethereum sub-protocols, cutting the bandwidth needed for a fast sync from 33.6GB to 13.5GB ([#15106](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15106)). This upgrade will improve the general bandwidth requirement of the network as well as light clients too.\r\n* Introducing a more sophisticated memory caching for state tries, reducing disk IO by a couple orders of magnitude. Exact number are pending a final implementation ([#14952](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14952)).\r\n\r\n## Trezor wallets\r\n\r\nAbout this time last year we've introduced support for the Ledger hardware wallet. Due to popular demand, we've now expanded on our hardware wallet offering by also rolling out support for the Trezor ([#14885](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14885)).\r\n\r\nOpposed to the Ledger however, the Trezor is a bit more complicated as it requires a PIN-unlock sent from the communicating machine instead of directly input by the user. As such, when a user plugs in a Trezor, Geth will print:\r\n\r\n`New wallet appeared, failed to open url=trezor://0003:0007:00 err=\"trezor: pin needed\"`\r\n\r\nThe Geth console can be used to unlock the Trezor by invoking `personal.openWallet(url)`, which will request the user to enter the shuffled PIN code and send that over to the Trezor for verification:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> personal.openWallet(\"trezor://0003:0007:00\")\r\n\r\nLook at the device for number positions\r\n\r\n7 | 8 | 9\r\n--+---+--\r\n4 | 5 | 6\r\n--+---+--\r\n1 | 2 | 3\r\n\r\nPlease enter current PIN:\r\n\r\nINFO [08-10|11:58:06] New wallet appeared url=trezor://0003:0007:00 status=\"Trezor v1.5.0 'Hi' online\"\r\n```\r\nFor details on how to interact with the Trezor from the JSON-RPC APIs, please consult the [PR description](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14885).\r\n\r\n## Transaction journal\r\n\r\nIn the 1.6.x release family of Geth we've introduced a new transaction pool to avoid propagation issues due to minimum gas-price requirements. This new pool accepted all transactions irrelevant of pricing, and always kept the best paying 4K of them, discarding the cheaper ones.\r\n\r\nThe new pool features a special exemption mechanism for local accounts so that a user's own transactions are always prioritized over remote ones, even if they are under-priced compared to everyone else's. This ensures that cheap transactions don't get flushed out of the network during heavy usage (e.g. ICO) as long as the originating node remains online.\r\n\r\nGeth 1.7.0 takes this protective measure a step forward by journaling all locally created transactions to disk, and loading them back up on a node restart. This ensures that even if the originating node goes offline, cheap transactions still have a chance to be included when the node comes back ([#14784](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/14784)).\r\n\r\nThe transaction journal can be an enormous help for node operators during software upgrades by not having to worry about local transactions going missing. Furthermore, the journal also acts as a resiliency mechanism against node crashes, ensuring that no transaction data is lost.\r\n\r\n## Rinkeby updates\r\n\r\nThere have been a lot of subtle tunings made to Puppeth and Rinkeby over the course of this release, such as better ethstats logging to detect malicious reporters and IP address blacklisting to deny access for them.\r\n\r\nThe Rinkeby testnet also proved vital in finding and and fixing a transaction pool event race that caused a lot of headache around lost transactions and/or duplicate nonce assignments. All such known errors have now been fixed ([#15085](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/15085)).\r\n\r\nLastly we're extremely happy to announce that [Infura became an active player](https://blog.infura.io/infuras-signer-and-bootnode-on-rinkeby-440de6f70961) in the Rinkeby test network by aiding the community both with their own bootnode as well as running an authorized signer node. This should make the Rinkeby network even more robust and resilient.\r\n\r\n## Closing remarks\r\n\r\nGeth 1.7.0 contains a lot of bug fixes and we consider it our best release until now, however we urge everyone to take care with the upgrade and monitor it closely afterwards as it does contain non-trivial database upgrades.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we'd like to emphasize that **the upgraded database cannot be used by previous versions of Geth**. Our recommendation for production users it to sync from scratch with Geth 1.7.0, and leave the old database backed up until you confirm that the new release works correctly for all your use cases.\r\n\r\nFor a full rundown of the changes please consult the [Geth 1.7.0 release milestone](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pulls?page=1&amp;q=is%3Apr+milestone%3A1.7.0+is%3Aclosed).\r\n\r\n**As always, binaries and mobile libraries are available on our [download page](https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/).**",

This affects the `personal_importRawKey` RPC method.\r\n\r\nPreviously hidden transaction pool defaults can now be set:\r\n\r\n```\r\n--txpool.pricelimit value    Minimum gas price limit to enforce for acceptance into the pool (default: 1)\r\n--txpool.pricebump value     Price bump percentage to replace an already existing transaction (default: 10)\r\n--txpool.accountslots value  Minimum number of executable transaction slots guaranteed per account (default: 16)\r\n--txpool.globalslots value   Maximum number of executable transaction slots for all accounts (default: 4096)\r\n--txpool.accountqueue value  Maximum number of non-executable transaction slots permitted per account (default: 64)\r\n--txpool.globalqueue value   Maximum number of non-executable transaction slots for all accounts (default: 1024)\r\n--txpool.lifetime value      Maximum amount of time non-executable transaction are queued (default: 3h0m0s)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor other minor changes in this release, see the [1.6.2 milestone](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/milestone/49?closed=1).\r\n\r\n**Binaries and mobile libraries are available on our [download page](https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/).**",

The major release was due to the September 15th hard fork, which in turn increased the minimum ring signature size to 5 across the network, banned duplicate ring members in a ring signature, and enforced the use of ringCT for all transaction outputs. This release of the software presents a number of major improvements to Monero, as well as a large set of bug fixes.\r\n\r\n[**The GUI release notes and downloads can be found on the release page here.**](https://github.com/monero-project/monero-core/releases/tag/v0.11.1.0)\r\n\r\nSome highlights of this point release are:\r\n\r\n- fixed an occasional sync failure that occurred when a transaction was already in the mempool\r\n- added an underflow check on low block heights\r\n- added a guard against a mined block not finding all the transactions in the mempool\r\n- fixed the transaction size estimator for transactions with a large number of inputs\r\n- fixed an LMDB issue on 32-bit systems\r\n- the get_tx_backlog RPC call was unrestricted\r\n- threads now guard against exceptions during transaction verification\r\n- fixed a crash that could occur when checking pre-validated transactions\r\n- various other bug fixes and improvements\r\n\r\nSome highlights of the major release this is a part of are:\r\n\r\n- major synchronisation speed-up from reducing bandwidth used\r\n- massively improved the blockchain import function\r\n- changed terminology from \"mixin\" to \"ring size\"\r\n- add a --fluffy-blocks option to relay blocks as fluffy blocks if possible\r\n- allow for password verification without loading the subsequently unencrypted wallet into RAM\r\n- reduced privacy leak risks when using untrusted remote nodes\r\n- added an Esperanto wordlist for mnemonic seed choices\r\n- decreased memory demands for the getblocks RPC call\r\n- added a \"fee\" command to display fee information\r\n- transfer CLI command warns if there's a tx backlog for selected fee\r\n- add average seconds per block in bc\\_dyn\\_stats\r\n- added an on\\_get\\_alt\\_blocks\\_hashes RPC call \r\n- added an Italian translation for the CLI\r\n- return the per-tx amount in the transfer\\_split RPC call\r\n- switched to readline for the CLI\r\n- automatically switch to SAFE db-sync-mode once daemon catches up to network\r\n- added a histogram to poolstats\r\n- major speed-up for poolstats and coinbase\\_tx\\_sum\r\n- enable support for macOS smart mining\r\n- added the ability to build a Snap package\r\n- added a Vulnerability Response Process, with bug bounties available via [a dedicated HackerOne portal](https://hackerone.com/monero)\r\n- added support for payment proving via key derivation instead of tx key reveal\r\n- changed output selection for ring signatures to heavily weight newer outputs\r\n- added a sweep\\_below function to sweep small amounts\r\n- moved the mempool to a database on disk instead of keeping it all in memory\r\n- fully enable iOS and Android full node support\r\n- enabled support for ppc64le architectures\r\n- added the ability to create and open wallets via RPC\r\n- added ability to relay transactions manually after creating them\r\n- better AC / battery power detection for Linux smart mining\r\n- getblocktemplate now indicates the expected total reward\r\n- as always, loads of bug fixes and performance improvements\r\n\r\n# Contributors for this Release\r\n\r\nThis release was the direct result of 39 people who worked, largely unpaid and altruistically, to put out 583 commits containing 60 350 new lines of code.

                "description": "# Overview\n\nThis is the next major release of Monero. It adds an initial release of RingCT, which is already live on testnet. The RingCT whitepaper [can be found here](https://lab.getmonero.org/pubs/MRL-0005.pdf). Note that the v4 hard fork has been moved to the beginning of January, 2017, although the v5 hard fork remains set at September, 2017. This is to enable early availability of RingCT transactions on the Monero network, although they will not be enforced as the only possible transaction type until the v5 hard fork.\n\nOne of the largest pieces of work were the BlockchainDB performance improvements. This was largely done by warptangent, an early Monero contributor who passed away in March, 2016. His work was completed by Howard \"hyc\" Chu, and we have named this release after him. We are deeply grateful for all the effort he put in to making Monero what it is today.\n\nSome highlights of this release are:\n- major performance improvements, especially on spinning disks\n- major space saving gains for the blockchain, despite the performance improvements\n- renamed binaries to follow a more logical, consistent convention\n- RingCT...obviously:)\n- added libunwind support for better crash reporting\n- added a key image export and import function for full watch-only wallet functionality\n- added support for ARMv8 processors\n- added a do_not_relay flag for transactions sent to the daemon\n- added a sweep_all command and RPC call for the wallet\n- significant fixes and improvements to threading\n- add a get_transfers RPC call\n- added transfer tracking to the wallet (lost forever if the wallet cache is deleted)\n- added a filter_by_height option to get_transfers\n- added a --max-concurrency flag for the wallet\n- major improvements to ARM performance, especially on newer 64-bit chips\n- huge overhaul of cmake and the readme\n- added a wallet API for the GUI\n- added a fee multiplier and reduced fees\n- made monero-wallet-cli more robust when handling corrupt caches\n- prompt twice for a wallet password to avoid password issues\n- improved daemon 'status' details, including time to the next fork\n- more bug fixes than you can shake a stick at\n- temporary patch (via a predefined user-agent) for the CSRF attack against monero-wallet-cli's RPC API, as disclosed by Henry Hoggard\n\n# Updating: Blockchain Conversion\n\nDue to the space savings and performance gains it is again highly recommended that you delete the contents of your Monero working directory and sync from scratch. This directory can be found in ~/.bitmonero on Linux and OS X, and on Windows in \\Users\\username\\AppData\\Roaming\\bitmonero or \\ProgramData\\bitmonero.\n\nAlternatively, you can use `blockchain_export` from your previous install to export your current blockchain, then delete the lmdb folder in your working directory, and finally use `monero-blockchain-import` from 0.10.0 to reimport it.\n\n# Contributors for this Release\n\nThis release was the direct result of 28 people who worked, largely unpaid and altruistically, to put out 725 commits containing 15 332 new lines of code.

                "description": "## Community Fund Enabled on the Testnet\r\n\r\nThe community fund which we are voting to implement has been implemented to the NavCoin testnet for everyone to try. The testnet stake rewards are reduced to 4% and there is 0.25 NAV per block generated by the staker and sent to the Community Fund Smart Contract.\r\n\r\nYou can help us to test the proposal, voting and redemption smart contract features we have proposed to implement on the mainnet. We have created a new genesis block for the testnet, so if you\u2019ve been using it previously, please re-sync once you\u2019ve downloaded the 4.1.0 wallet.\r\n\r\n## New Majority Version Alert\r\n\r\nWe have added a feature which allows the wallet to track the version number of the other wallets on the network. If your wallet detects a majority of wallets to be on a greater version number than its own version number, it will alert you that a new update is available.\r\n\r\n## Security Updates\r\n\r\nAside from the early access features, the main priority for this release is to secure the network. Bittrex alerted us to some reported instability of the blockchain they were seeing and after some thorough investigation and we were able to find the cause and we have included a preventative security patch in this latest version of the wallet. \r\n\r\nThe main changes have been to make improvements to the script check methods and we have also added the nTime & strDzeel parameters to the signature hash. This security patch will prevent the recently seen network instabilities moving forward and resolve the issues Bittrex have reported. It will also make these changes compatible with NavPay which we are still on schedule to release later this month.\r\n\r\nMaking these security improvements to the script check is a change to the consensus mechanism and requires a majority consensus to be accepted on the network. We have decided the best course of action is to implement the security patch as a mandatory hard fork instead of waiting for a majority consensus to be organically achieved.\r\n\r\n**The network will reject blocks and transactions from versions older than 4.1.0 from 11 December 2017 @ 11:00am GMT.**\r\n\r\nThe network will take some time to stabilize after the fork occurs, so we suggest not sending any NAV for up to 48 hours after the hard fork time. We will post a message to the community once we see the network is stable and we are starting to bring the exchanges back online for deposits and withdrawals.\r\n\r\nTo help stabilize the network, please update to the new client before the fork time and stake your coins to mint blocks.\r\n\r\n## Install Instructions\r\n\r\nTo have a smooth transition to the new version, please download 4.1.0 and install it before the hard fork time is reached. If you're using the GUI you will be prompted to allow the wallet to rebuild the database. If you've running the daemon, you will need to run it with the -reindex flag before you will be able to use the new daemon.\r\n\r\nIf you're using the NavPi there are some extra steps to get up and running with the new version.\r\n\r\nFrom the control panel page, click the `update` button and update the UI from GitHub.\r\nRun the updater script located at `/home/stakebox/UI/libs/updater.sh` or wait for the autoupdater to run if you are on version 1.0.3 or later.\r\nWhen you see the notice on the homepage of your NavPi stating that a new update has been installed, click the button to reboot the device.\r\nWhen your device has rebooted, go back to the control page and click the `Reindex` button and reindex the blockchain.\r\n\r\nNote that in some instances, it will be unable to reindex the blockchain and the wallet will unfortunately be required to resync the blockchain which can take some time.\r\n\r\nIf you need to resync the blockchain, you can find a bootstrap to speed the process up here:\r\n\r\nhttps://build.nav.community/bootstrap\r\n\r\n## Full list of updates\r\n\r\n- New genesis block for the testnet. \r\n- Community fund enabled on the testnet.\r\n- New block version structure. Rejects blocks with wrong version.\r\n- Blocks will still signal version bits even after activation.\r\n- Nodes with obsolete protocol versions get their messages rejected instead of being banned.\r\n- Improvements in the Script check methods.\r\n- Reason for messages being rejected are now registered in the log file.\r\n- Signature Hash now includes nTime and strDZeel.\r\n- Wallet is able to track other wallet\u2019s versions and displays a warning when a majority has updated to a new version.\r\n- New format of stake voting. Votings can be dynamically be pushed into the network. New RPC method \u2018stakervote\u2019.\r\n- Adds \u2018donatefund\u2019 RPC method to donate to the community fund.\r\n- Moved many consensus related parameters to chainparams.cpp\r\n- Fixes a bug where a transaction could have a timestamp earlier than the outputs it spent.\r\n- Fixes a bug where the staker thread could be interrupted.\r\n- Fixes a bug which prevents node to start syncing at boot under some circumstances.\r\n\r\n## SHA256 Hashes\r\n\r\n### navcoin-4.1.0-osx.dmg \r\n4fe674e873fecdf20c2307ff0ce7d39e4c6a986f88b3149d80b17b8bf871a67e  \r\n\r\n### navcoin-4.1.0-osx64.tar.gz\r\n1f0e91f2312d02198424e7ed63452d6ad66259a85dc976c4630b44626ea05618  \r\n\r\ne1abad93238d1468ea9a60751a9dfc6a1182f6ecd5ae859f25a595ec2b424216  navcoin-4.1.0-win32-setup.exe\r\n\r\n### navcoin-4.1.0-win32.zip\r\n2a0714c8687cd8c8da5da258d4b9197f0dc52bb526c70daac1631faf08b51859  \r\n\r\n### navcoin-4.1.0-win64-setup.exe\r\n5e4f67111fe1df21f410ec5b8b14ea0b7e8f0fe991c70b9dbae39afc3cb66b63  \r\n\r\n### navcoin-4.1.0-win64.zip\r\n15f71cafde5701a8879b2984effba0a8526316b941117aecd9495bd5d0be3fc3  \r\n\r\n### navcoin-4.1.0-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\nab8b6964385814754acda6b1ea443dd04f8b30e3c1030971f370082e54e8d6e7  \r\n\r\n### navcoin-4.1.0-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz\r\nd330adb5e01e1d8206af7281107e5ee7a7be00960e9e4d3e8161fadf78d726c6  \r\n\r\n### navcoin-4.1.0-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\n388266ef1d96b14629a4a7b8a53de74bb35bdc17ea4a010b012ed24d573d3319  \r\n\r\n### navcoin-4.1.0-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\n43c2b206cb878a6c57219a9d6654e28bb53e9fe563005ab7cb8064ee96407a31  \r\n\r\n### navcoin-4.1.0.tar.gz\r\n89214562c90211bbf4931ad0ff5c039c05567a7c3a301724f150ffa5a5e346dd  ",

This was in previous versions of Proof of Stake due to its aid in security dealing with the &quot;loose&quot; coinstake transaction that is produced independent of blocks by finding a &quot;kernel&quot; that creates a secondary hash to meet the stake difficulty requirements. Stake searching was done by searching back in time from coinstake/block timestamp to find a &quot;hash&quot; that meets difficulty.<br /><br /><b>H]</b> Total Coins Staking doesn&#039;t just influence how easy it is to find a Proof of Stake hash, it also determines how low your energy threshold is. This means that if you have more Niro up to the &quot;MAX_STAKE_AMOUNT&quot;, you can search with up to 8 nNonce / Second which allows energy efficiency, and also regulation in the block production. The Required Energy Threshold is modeled from this Equation:<br /><br /><img class=\"userimg\" src=\"http://nexusoft.io/platform/binaries/testnet/Required.png\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /><br /><br /><i>Your weight directly influences your required energy threshold, or exactly how quickly you are able to search for a block hash that meets the current difficulty. This is much safer than calculating it in the hash, as the hash even at consistent targets can vary in their difficulty to find, which means that regulating the time differences between different weights using the block hash is very inconsistent resulting in insecure staking, even under higher difficulty.</i><br /><br /><b>I]</b> Trust Keys are established and stored in the &quot;Trust Pool&quot; which is a seperate memory-only structure I developed soley for use with trust keys. This allows this pool to add or remove blocks from a trust key to determine the age and root of the Trust Key.<br /><br /><b>J]</b> Two Transaction Types for Staking, The Trust Transaction and the Genesis Transaction. The Genesis transaction is the very first transaction that the network has seen with given trust key. It must adhere to the rules of Genesis Transactions, and be accepted into the Trust Pool to create the Trust Key. Trust Transactions then must use the hash of the Trust Key which is combined from GenesisBlock (first block trust key created), nTime (time of block), vchPubKey (binary data of public key), hashGenesisTx (hash of the Genesis Transaction) as the first input previous output in order to verify that Trust Transaction is tied to given Genesis Transaction, so that it cannot be manipulated. The Genesis Transaction marks the root of the Trust Key to determine its age and interest rates.<br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 12pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;\"><i>Weight for a Genesis Transaction Versus a Trust Transaction Follow These two curves. You can see that the Genesis Transaction Weight takes up to 90 days to reach full, as to where a Trust transaction builds your weight up in your Trust Key, to be maintained as long as the trust key doesn&#039;t expire. Genesis Transaction weights reset every new Genesis Transaction.</i></span><br /><br /><img class=\"userimg\" src=\"http://nexusoft.io/platform/binaries/testnet/weight-graph.jpg\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /><br /><br /><i>Note the Green is Trust Weight, and the Blue is Genesis Weight. Genesis Weight Expires after Genesis Transaction, Trust Weight Builds every Trust Block created by given Trust Key.</i><br /><br /><b>K]</b> Trust Transactions cannot be created before Minimum Interval, or what this means is that a Trust Transaction can only be produced every X blocks (5 blocks for this testnet) in order to be validated by the network. This prevents the Trust Key holder from being able to create a chain comprised solely of Trust Blocks, or to attempt to build up Genesis or Trust Weight in order to attack as they will find their limitations after the Genesis Transaction.<br /><br /><b>L]</b> Trust Weight and Trust Interest builds the longer you stake, and expires after the given trust key reaches its expiration time. This means that a Trust Key must continue to service the network to maintain their trust and therefore the benefits of having that trust. This testnet has the Trust Key Expiration set to 1 Day.<br /></span><br /><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size: 14pt !important; line-height: 1.3em;\">\n",

Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/PIVX-Qt (on Mac) or pivxd/pivx-qt (on Linux).\r\n\r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\n==============\r\n\r\nPIVX Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using\r\nthe Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support),\r\nNo attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP, you\r\ncan still do so at your own risk but be aware that there are known instabilities and issues.\r\nPlease do not report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.\r\n\r\nPIVX Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not\r\nfrequently tested on them.\r\n\r\n### :exclamation::exclamation::exclamation: MacOS 10.13 High Sierra :exclamation::exclamation::exclamation:\r\n\r\n**Currently there are issues with the 3.0.x gitian releases on MacOS version 10.13 (High Sierra), no reports of issues on older versions of MacOS. As such, a High Sierra Only version is included below.**\r\n\r\n\r\nNotable Changes\r\n===============\r\n\r\nAutomated Database Corruption Repair\r\n---------------------\r\nThere have been cases of blockchain database corruption that can occur when PIVX client is not closed gracefully. The most common cases of corruption have been identified and the wallet will now automatically fix most of these corruptions. Certain corruption states are still unable to be fixed, but now provide more detailed error messages to the user as well as prompting the user to reindex their database.\r\n\r\nMore Accurate Error Messages\r\n---------------------\r\nSome error messages in the wallet have been too vague and done little to help developers and the support team properly identify issues. Error messages have been refined and are now more specific.\r\n\r\nReduction of Debug Log Spam\r\n---------------------\r\nMany 3rd party services have reported that their debug logs have been overloaded with messages about unknown transaction types. This log spam has been fixed.\r\n\r\nRemoval of Heavy Running Transaction Search Code\r\n---------------------\r\nMany areas of the block validation code use a \"slow\" transaction search, which searches redundantly for transactions. This \"slow\" search has been removed upstream in Bitcoin and is now removed in PIVX. This provides a more efficient syncing process and generally better performing wallet.\r\n\r\nSync Fix for Block 908000\r\n---------------------\r\nMany wallets were having trouble getting past block 908000. This block recalculates certain aspects of the money supply and zPIV transactions, and is known to take longer to sync. Code has been added to allow block 908000 to be validated without the user needing to enter any special commands into the debug console.\r\n\r\nWorking Testnet\r\n---------------------\r\nTestnet is now accessible with this release of the wallet. Testnet can be accessed using the `-testnet` startup flag.\r\n\r\nzPIV Spending Fix\r\n---------------------\r\nzPIV that were minted between block 891730 and 895400 were experiencing an error initializing the accumulator witness data correctly, causing an inability to spend those mints. This has been fixed.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0.6 Change log\r\n=================\r\n\r\nDetailed release notes follow.

As such, a High Sierra Only version is included below.**\r\n\r\n\r\nNotable Changes\r\n===============\r\n\r\nAccumulator Code Refactor\r\n---------------------\r\nThe zPIV accumulator code has undergone a major refactor. Accumulators are one of the most essential components of the zerocoin protocol, and also one of the most computationally expensive parts of the protocol. This refactoring speeds up syncing and spending of zPIV by over 5x. The new code also allows for spending of zPIV with only 2 required mints occurring on the network after your mint has been added, whereas before 3 were required. This refactor allows for lighter resource load and a smoother user experience.\r\n\r\nlibzerocoin Exploit Fix\r\n---------------------\r\nzPIV relies on a 3rd party library called libzerocoin. All currencies that utilize the zerocoin protocol use libzerocoin, and many of those currencies have been exposed to an exploit which allowed for the creation of multiple zero-knowledge spending proofs for one single zerocoin mint. The PIVX developers were able properly identify the exploit, track down any fraudulent spending proofs, link the fraudulent spending proofs with their one valid proof that they were mutated from, and remove any mints from the accumulators that were derived from the invalid spends. \r\n\r\nzPIV Maintenance Mode Spork\r\n---------------------\r\nHandling the above noted libzerocoin exploit required the PIVX team to immediately release a patched wallet to as many users as possible which rejected bad spends and also disabled all zPIV transactions in general. The process of releasing a patched wallet in such a small time frame is frustrating and difficult for all members of the PIVX team and especially users of PIVX. The PIVX developers have added a new spork which allows for zPIV transacting to be turned on/off without having to release a patched wallet. This will allow much smoother operation if any problems occur in the future, and should also allow exchanges and 3rd party services to continue to operate even if zPIV is in maintenance mode.\r\n\r\nMoney Supply Indexing\r\n---------------------\r\nThe exploit in libzerocoin threw off some of the wallet's internal money supply calculations for both the zPIV supply and the PIV supply. User's wallet's will automatically recalculate the supply on block `908001`. User's also have the ability to recalculate supply using the startup flag `reindexmoneysupply`.\r\n\r\nMore Extensive Tracking of zPIV Supply Through RPC\r\n---------------------\r\nMore information has been added to the `getinfo` and `getblock` RPC calls, which now display the total zPIV supply as well as the balance for each zPIV accumulator.\r\n\r\nMultisig GUI\r\n---------------------\r\nProvides functionality which is currently only available through raw transactions. Multisignature addresses require signatures from multiple parties before coins belonging to the address are spent. Accessed through the File dropdown menu.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0.5 Change log\r\n=================\r\n\r\nDetailed release notes follow.

If you are on a blockchain beyond 895400 that includes exploited transactions, this wallet will likely fail on load with a message about a corrupted database. This should be able to be fixed using the reindex feature `./pivx-qt -reindex=1`\r\n\r\nIf you are not comfortable with temporary releases, or are confused, the best course of action will be to shutdown your wallet, backup your data, and wait for an official release.\r\n\r\nMost importantly **backup your data**.

As such, a High Sierra Only version is included below.**\r\n\r\n\r\nNotable Changes\r\n===============\r\n\r\nRefactoring of zPiv Spend Validation Code\r\n---------------------\r\nzPiv spend validation was too rigid and did not give enough slack for reorganizations. Many staking wallets were unable to reorganize back to the correct blockchain when they had an orphan stake which contained a zPiv spend. zPiv double spending validation has been refactored to properly account for reorganization.\r\n\r\nMoney Supply Calculation Fix\r\n---------------------\r\nCoin supply incorrectly was counting spent zPiv as newly minted coins that are added to the coin supply, thus resulting in innacurate coin supply data.\r\n\r\nThe coin supply is now correctly calculated. If a new wallet client is synced from scratch or if `-reindex=1` is used then the correct money supply will be calculated. If neither of these two options are used, the wallet client will automatically reindex the money supply calculations upon the first time opening the software after updating to v3.0.4. The reindex takes approximately 10-60 minutes depending on the hardware used. If the reindex is exited mid-process, it will continue where it left off upon restart.\r\n\r\nBetter Filtering of Transactions in Stake Miner\r\n---------------------\r\nThe stake miner code now filters out zPiv double spends that were on rare occasions being slipped into blocks (and being rejected by peers when broadcast to the network).\r\n\r\nMore Responsive Shutdown Requests\r\n---------------------\r\nWhen computationally expensive accumulator calculations are being performed and the user requests to close the application, the wallet will exit much sooner than before.\r\n\r\nMore Extensive Display of zPiv Confirmation/Maturity Status\r\n---------------------\r\nWithin the Privacy Dialog of the QT wallet, the _Zerocoin Stats_ section now displays both the confirmation and maturity status of minted zPiv's. Previously this was only able to be viewed within the zPiv Control dialog. The main Overview tab of the QT wallet now splits zPiv balance into subcategories: _Unconfirmed_, _Immature_, and _Mature_.\r\n\r\n3.0.4 Change log\r\n=================\r\n\r\nDetailed release notes follow.

This release contains transaction creation bug fixes for zPIV spends, automint calculation adjustments, and other various updates/fixes.\r\n\r\nzPIV spending requires this update.\r\n\r\nHow to Upgrade\r\n==============\r\n\r\nIf you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/PIVX-Qt (on Mac) or pivxd/pivx-qt (on Linux).\r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\n==============\r\n\r\nPIVX Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using\r\nthe Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support),\r\nNo attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP, you\r\ncan still do so at your own risk but be aware that there are known instabilities and issues.\r\nPlease do not report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.\r\n\r\nPIVX Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not\r\nfrequently tested on them.\r\n\r\n### :exclamation::exclamation::exclamation: MacOS 10.13 High Sierra :exclamation::exclamation::exclamation:\r\n\r\n**Currently there are issues with the 3.0.x gitian releases on MacOS version 10.13 (High Sierra), no reports of issues on older versions of MacOS.**\r\n\r\n\r\nNotable Changes\r\n===============\r\n\r\nAuto Wallet Backup\r\n---------------------\r\nIn addition to the automatic wallet backup that is done at each start of the client, a new automatic backup function has been added that will, by default, create a backup of the wallet file during each zPIV mint operation (zPIV spends which re-mint their change are also included in this). This functionality is controlled by the `-backupzpiv` command-line option, which defaults to `1` (enabled, auto-backup).\r\n\r\nUsers that wish to prevent this behavior (not recommended) can pass `-backupzpiv=0` at the command-line when starting the client, or add `backupzpiv=0` to their `pivx.conf` file.\r\n\r\nzPIV Automint Calculations\r\n---------------------\r\nA bug in the automint calculations was made apparent on mainnet when block times exceeded expectations, resulting in zPIV mint transactions that were in an unconfirmed state to still be treated as if they had never been minted. This caused automint to effectively mint more than what was intended.\r\n\r\nzPIV Spending Fix\r\n---------------------\r\nThe size of zPIV spend transactions is knowingly larger than normal transactions, and while this was expected, a much stricter check against the scriptsig size is used for mainnet, causing the transactions to be rejected by the mempool, and thus not being packaged into any blocks.\r\n\r\nzPIV Transaction Recovery\r\n---------------------\r\nDue to the aforementioned issue with zPIV spending, users may find that their attempted spends are now conflicted and zPIV balances are not represented as expected. \"Recovery\" of these transactions can be done using the following methods:\r\n\r\n1. GUI:\r\n\r\n   The Privacy tab has the `Reset` and `Rescan` buttons that can be used to restore these mints/spends from a state of being marked as unavailable.\r\n\r\n2. RPC:\r\n\r\n   The RPC commands `resetspentzerocoin` and `resetmintzerocoin` are the command-line counterparts to the above, and can be used by users that do not use the GUI wallet.\r\n\r\nRPC Changes\r\n---------------------\r\nThe `bip38decrypt` command has had it's parameter order changed to be more consistent with it's counterpart. The command now expects the PIVX address as it's first parameter and the passphrase as it's second parameter.\r\n\r\nBip38 Compatibility With 3rd Party Tools\r\n---------------------\r\nThe in-wallet bip38 encryption method was leaving the final 4 bytes of the encrypted key blank. This caused an incompatibility issue with 3rd party tools like the paper wallet generators that could decrypt bip38 encrypted keys. Cross-tool compatibility has now been restored.\r\n\r\n3.0.2 Change log\r\n=================\r\n\r\nDetailed release notes follow.

This release contains new consensus rules and improvements that are not backwards compatible with older versions. Users will have a grace period of one week to update their clients before enforcement of this update is enabled.\r\n\r\nUsers updating from a previous version after the 13th of October will require a full resync of their local blockchain from either the P2P network or by way of the bootstrap.\r\n\r\nHow to Upgrade\r\n==============\r\n\r\nIf you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/PIVX-Qt (on Mac) or pivxd/pivx-qt (on Linux).\r\n\r\nCompatibility\r\n==============\r\n\r\nPIVX Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using\r\nthe Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support),\r\nNo attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP, you\r\ncan still do so at your own risk but be aware that there are known instabilities and issues.\r\nPlease do not report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.\r\n\r\nPIVX Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not\r\nfrequently tested on them.\r\n\r\n### :exclamation::exclamation::exclamation: MacOS 10.13 High Sierra :exclamation::exclamation::exclamation:\r\n\r\n**Currently there are issues with the 3.0.0 gitian release on MacOS version 10.13 (High Sierra), no reports of issues on older versions of MacOS.**\r\n\r\n\r\nNotable Changes\r\n===============\r\n\r\nZerocoin (zPIV) Protocol\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nAt long last, the zPIV release is here and the zerocoin protocol has been fully implemented! This allows users to send transactions with 100% fungible coins and absolutely zero history or link-ability to their previous owners.\r\n\r\nThe Zerocoin protocol allows user to convert (mint) their *PIV* to zerocoins, which we call *zPIV*. When zPIV are converted back to PIV there is no trail associated with the coins being sent, such as who originally minted those coins. Essentially the only thing the receiver of the zPIV transaction will see is that it came from the zerocoin protocol.\r\n\r\n### zPIV Denominations\r\nzPIV comes in specific denominations of 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, and 5000. A denomination is a similar concept to paper currency, where you can hold a $100 bill but there is no available $99 bill for you to hold.\r\n\r\nOther implementations of the zerocoin protocol only allow for spending of one denomination/zerocoin at a time. The PIVX implementation of zerocoin allows users to spend any amount of zPIV they would like (with certain limitations). If a user held two denominations of 5 and they send 7.75 to a merchant, the wallet will automatically grab the two denominations of 5 and then issue 2.25 PIV in change to the spender. There is currently a limit of up to 6 individual zerocoin `coins` that can be combined into a spend, where each `coin` could be a different or similar denomination\r\n\r\nThe PIVX zerocoin implementation is structured in such a way that denominations aren't needed to be known by the average user.\r\n\r\n### Fees\r\nzPiv transactions require more computation and disk space than typical PIVX transactions, and as such require a higher transaction fee in order to prevent network spam. Fees are only charged when minting zPiv, each minted denomination is charged a flat rate of 0.01 Piv. zPiv spends are not charged a transaction fee unless the change is minted into zPiv, see the *Minting Change* section for details on fees for zPiv spends with minted change.\r\n\r\n### Converting PIV to zPIV (*zPIV Mint*)\r\n**GUI** - Conversion from PIV to zPIV can be done using the `Privacy Dialog` in the QT wallet. Enter the amount of PIV you would like to convert and click `Mint Zerocoin`. \r\n\r\n**RPC** - Conversion from PIV to zPIV can be done using the `mintzerocoin` command.\r\n\r\n**Automint** - The PIVX wallet is set to convert 10% of the wallets available PIV to zPIV automatically. This can be adjusted in the GUI within the Options dialog, which allows the preferred % to be adjusted as well as the ability to set the preferred zPIV denomination that will be minted. Automint is set to be triggered when additional blocks are added to the block chain and is programmed *not* to convert your coins all at once.\r\n\r\nAutomint can be disabled by adding `enablezeromint=0` to the wallet configuration file. The preferred mint % and denomination can also be set by the configuration file using `zeromintpercentage=<n>` and `preferredDenom=<n>`.\r\n\r\n### Converting zPIV to PIV (*zPIV Spend*)\r\nRedeeming zPIV is done by converting it back to PIV. With the 3.0.0 software release, users are not able to send zPIV to each other directly in an atomic fashion.\r\n\r\n**GUI** - Conversion from zPIV to PIV can be done using the `Privacy Dialog` in the QT wallet. Enter a PIVX address that you would like to Pay To, enter the amount of PIV the receiver should be sent, click `Spend Zerocoin`.\r\n\r\n**RPC** - Conversion from zPIV to PIV can be done using the `spendzerocoin` command.\r\n\r\n### Advanced Use & Privacy Considerations\r\n**Security Level** - When spending zPIV, a user is prompted to enter a *Security Level* choosing from 1-100. In an indirect way, the Security Level parameter allows the user to choose how many coins to obfuscate their transaction with. \r\n\r\nA Security Level of 1 for example would take all of the minted coins in the blockchain before your mint was added to the blockchain, and would then add any coins that were minted within the next 10 blocks as well. A Security Level of 2 would do the same thing, except add the next 20 blocks worth of mints. A **Security Level of 100 will add the maximum amount of mints** up to the current end of the blockchain. \r\n\r\nThe higher the Security Level, the more computation and time it will take to spend. Although it takes longer, a level of 100 is recommended for transactions that need maximum anonymity.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Minting Change** - The PIVX implementation of the zerocoin protocol also allows the spender to choose how to receive their leftover change from a Spend transaction. For maximum anonymity it is recommended that the spender choose to receive the change in zPIV, which prevents situations where change from a zPIV spend that is redeemed in PIV is accidentally mixed with the rest of the users PIV, thus linking transactions back to a PIVX address.\r\n\r\nSince the lowest denomination of zPIV is 1, and a fee is required to mint zPIV, in most situations a high fee will be paid to mint change. The fee is the remainder of the change that cannot be converted back to zPIV. For example this would mean a spending a denomination of 10 that yields change of 6.75 in change, would issue zPIV denominations of 5 and 1 back to the sender with the remaining 0.75 that is unmintable being contributed as a fee.\r\n\r\n**zPIV Control**\r\nSimilar to the concept of Coin Control in the QT wallet, zPIV Control allows users to select exactly which zPIV mints they would like to spend. This gives a flexibility to choose which denominations can be picked for a spend that wouldn't otherwise be available.\r\n\r\n\r\nTor Service Integration Improvements\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nIntegrating with Tor is now easier than ever! Starting with Tor version 0.2.7.1 it is possible, through Tor's control socket API, to create and destroy 'ephemeral' hidden services programmatically. PIVX Core has been updated to make use of this.\r\n\r\nThis means that if Tor is running (and proper authorization is available), PIVX Core automatically creates a hidden service to listen on, without manual configuration. PIVX Core will also use Tor automatically to connect to other .onion nodes if the control socket can be successfully opened. This will positively affect the number of available .onion nodes and their usage.\r\n\r\nThis new feature is enabled by default if PIVX Core is listening, and a connection to Tor can be made. It can be configured with the `-listenonion`, `-torcontrol` and `-torpassword` settings. To show verbose debugging information, pass `-debug=tor`.\r\n\r\n3.0.0 Change log\r\n=================\r\n\r\nDetailed release notes follow.

Future intention is to roll these two commands back into a single command to reduce code-duplication. Paramater arguments currently remain unchanged from the legacy command equivilent.\r\n\r\n##### `mnbudgetvote` Command #####\r\nThis command now handles all cases for submitting MN votes on a budget proposal. Backwards compatibility with the legacy command(s) has been retained, with the exception of the `vote-alias` case due to a conflict in paramater type casting. A user running `mnbudget vote-alias` will be instructed to instead use the new `mnvote` command.

Given no parameters, it returns the full list of budget proposals (`mnbudget show`). A single optional parameter allows to return information on just that proposal (`mnbudget getinfo`). Below is the full help documentation:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngetbudgetinfo ( \"proposal\" )\r\n\r\nShow current masternode budgets\r\n\r\nArguments:\r\n1. \"proposal\"    (string, optional) Proposal name\r\n\r\nResult:\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"Name\": \"xxxx\",               (string) Proposal Name\r\n    \"URL\": \"xxxx\",                (string) Proposal URL\r\n    \"Hash\": \"xxxx\",               (string) Proposal vote hash\r\n    \"FeeHash\": \"xxxx\",            (string) Proposal fee hash\r\n    \"BlockStart\": n,              (numeric) Proposal starting block\r\n    \"BlockEnd\": n,                (numeric) Proposal ending block\r\n    \"TotalPaymentCount\": n,       (numeric) Number of payments\r\n    \"RemainingPaymentCount\": n,   (numeric) Number of remaining payments\r\n    \"PaymentAddress\": \"xxxx\",     (string) PIVX address of payment\r\n    \"Ratio\": x.xxx,               (numeric) Ratio of yeas vs nays\r\n    \"Yeas\": n,                    (numeric) Number of yea votes\r\n    \"Nays\": n,                    (numeric) Number of nay votes\r\n    \"Abstains\": n,                (numeric) Number of abstains\r\n    \"TotalPayment\": xxx.xxx,      (numeric) Total payment amount\r\n    \"MonthlyPayment\": xxx.xxx,    (numeric) Monthly payment amount\r\n    \"IsEstablished\": true|false,  (boolean) Established (true) or (false)\r\n    \"IsValid\": true|false,        (boolean) Valid (true) or Invalid (false)\r\n    \"IsValidReason\": \"xxxx\",      (string) Error message, if any\r\n    \"fValid\": true|false,         (boolean) Valid (true) or Invalid (false)\r\n  }\r\n  ,...\r\n]\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n> pivx-cli getbudgetinfo\r\n> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{\"jsonrpc\": \"1.0\", \"id\":\"curltest\", \"method\": \"getbudgetinfo\", \"params\": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:51473/\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Masternode network protocol layer reporting ####\r\nThe results from the `listmasternodes` and `getmasternodecount` commands now includes details about which network protocol layer is being used (IPv4, IPV6, or Tor).\r\n\r\n\r\n2.3.1 Change log\r\n=================\r\n\r\nDetailed release notes follow.

                "description": "About Qtum and Mainnet Ignition\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nQtum is a decentralized blockchain project built on Bitcoin's UTXO model, with support for Ethereum Virtual Machine based smart contracts, and secured by a proof of stake consensus model. It achieves this through the revolutionary Account Abstraction Layer which allows the EVM to communicate with Qtum's Bitcoin-like UTXO blockchain. For more general information about Qtum as well as links to join our community, go to https://qtum.org\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Qtum Ignition Main Network. This is the main network where the tokens hold value and should be guarded very carefully. There will be a testnet setup soon for developers, in the meantime you can use `-regtest` mode for testing needs. We will announce details about the token swap from QTUM ERC20 coins to QTUM mainnet tokens soon, watch our [website](https://qtum.org) for details about that.  \r\n\r\nThe major features implemented in Qtum Ignition include:\r\n\r\n1. The Ethereum Virtual Machine, which allows for compatibility with most existing Solidity based smart contracts.\r\n2. The Smart Staking Protocol is complete, which is an optimized Proof of Stake implementation designed for a smart contract platform (however, smart contracts can not participate in staking yet).\r\n3. An early and basic smart contract GUI has been implemented that can be used for creating contracts, sending data and Qtum to them, and checking their status by executing them locally. This functionality is similar to Mist's UI right now, but it is still an early version. We will be working on this more to improve it. \r\n4. Regtest mode, which is ideal for developers who wish to create their own private blockchain. It is tuned specifically to make development easier. It will stake blocks automatically every 30 seconds, and can generate proof-of-work blocks instantly as needed.\r\n5. The Decentralized Governance Protocol is completely implemented and functional, which allows certain network parameters to be modified without a fork.\r\n\r\nFor more technical information for how to start developing with Qtum please read the [Guide](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/blob/master/doc/sparknet-guide.md) and also see this tutorial for deploying a simple [faucet smart contract](http://earlz.net/view/2017/06/30/2144/the-qtum-sparknet-faucet) (it hasn't yet been updated for Mainnet for obvious reasons, but all the instructions are the same and you can try them in regtest mode)\r\n\r\nNote: Qtum Core is considered beta software. We make no warranties or guarantees of its security or stability.\r\n\r\nUpdate History\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n* v0.14.12 - Recommended Update\r\n    * Added option to disable change address usage\r\n    * Fixed bug where heavy RPC usage could cause the wallet to crash\r\n* v0.14.11 - Optional Update\r\n    * Changed our versioning scheme to be consistent and avoid the two version number confusion\r\n    * Add feature to restore wallet in the Qt wallet\r\n    * Add new RPC call \"waitforlogs\" that is particularly useful for Dapp developers\r\n    * Add long-polling support to the gettransaction RPC call\r\n* v1.1.4 - Recommended update\r\n    * Fixed a bug that would cause syncing to stop\r\n    * Fixed a bug that would cause the wallet to crash when using -logevents\r\n* v1.1.3 - Highly recommended update\r\n    * Fixed a bug that caused contact addresses to show in receive token address dropdown\r\n* v1.1.2 - Optional update, but recommended if using QRC tokens\r\n    * Fixed a bug with token transactions where the transaction ID displayed was incorrect in the Qt wallet\r\n    * Allow adding 0 balance addresses as the token receiver in the Qt wallet\r\n* v1.1.1: When sending to contracts, the sender address is now the default change address to reduce confusion; fix -salvagewallet so it works with token transactions\r\n* v1.1.0: Add GUI support Qtum QRC tokens, allowing full management of tokens on the Qtum blockchain from the Qt wallet\r\n    * Sending to a contract no longer requires ABI data, allowing easy participation in simple crowdsale contracts\r\n* v1.0.4: Fix bug where certain circumstances when staking could cause the displayed balance to be inaccurate until completely redownloading the blockchain.\r\n* v1.0.3: Fix staker bug that reported false messages; slightly increases staking performance; optimize staker parameters; fix white send button in GUI\r\n* v1.0.2: Various UI fixes, minor gas overflow consensus fix, per-txout exploit fix, testnet mode setup and functioning\r\n* v1.0.1: Fixed network magic bytes and minimum version to ensure the main network does not conflict with the Skynet network\r\n* v1.0: Initial release\r\n\r\nReindex Required When Upgrading from v1.0.1\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhen you first start the Qtum 1.0.2 GUI wallet after using Qtum v1.0.1 it will prompt you that it must reindex the database. This is normal and is a result of switching our internal database format from per-transaction to per-txout. If you use `qtumd -daemon` it will silently fail to start. You need to use `qtumd -daemon -reindex` in this case. \r\n\r\nQtum Documentation and Usage Resources\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nBasic usage resources:\r\n\r\n* [Official Qtum Usage Guide](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/wiki/Qtum-Wallet-Tutorial)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum staking tutorial](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/qtum-staking-tutorial-using-qtum-qt)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum staking tutorial on Raspberry Pi](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/qtum-staking-tutorial-using-qtumd-on-a-raspberry-pi-3)\r\n* [Unofficial guide for keeping your wallet safe](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/encrypting-backing-up-and-restoring-your-qtum-wallet)\r\n* [Block explorer](https://explorer.qtum.org)\r\n* [Unofficial block explorer](https://qtumexplorer.io/)\r\n* [Unofficial Raspberry Pi Web UI](https://github.com/rpiwalletui/qtum-ui)\r\n\r\nDevelopment resources:\r\n\r\n* [Deploying a custom token to Qtum](https://blog.qtum.org/qtum-custom-token-walkthrough-467d725fa27d)\r\n* [Early example faucet contract](http://earlz.net/view/2017/06/30/2144/the-qtum-sparknet-faucet)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum Hello World tutorial](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/quantum-qtum-blockchain-developer-tutorial-hello-world)\r\n\r\nGeneral Info about Qtum:\r\n\r\n* [Mainnet event AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/comments/6zs8t0/official_qtum_ama_thread_starts_at_10pm_beijing/)\r\n* [Qtum's PoS vs CASPER](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/comments/788oa5/qtums_pos_vs_casper_and_the_nothingatstake_problem/)\r\n* [Technical article explaining Qtum's PoS model in depth](http://earlz.net/view/2017/07/27/1904/the-missing-explanation-of-proof-of-stake-version)\r\n* [Unofficial What is Qtum article](https://storeofvalue.github.io/posts/what-is-qtum-without-the-bullshit/)\r\n\r\nQuickstart\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get started with Qtum is to simply download the binaries below. To give a brief breakdown of the different versions available: \r\n\r\n#### Windows\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.12-win64.zip](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v0.14.12/qtum-0.14.12-win64.zip) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using Windows.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.12-win64-setup-unsigned.exe](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v0.14.12/qtum-0.14.12-win64-setup-unsigned.exe) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using Windows.

If you have an older Windows computer and don't care about installing Qtum system-wide, \r\n* [qtum-0.14.12-win32-setup-unsigned.exe](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v0.14.12/qtum-0.14.12-win32-setup-unsigned.exe) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 machines using Windows. This includes an installer and will install Qtum system wide. If you have an older Windows computer and want to install Qtum then this is for you.\r\n\r\n#### OSX\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.12-osx64.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v0.14.12/qtum-0.14.12-osx64.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using OSX. If you use a modern Mac and want development tools, this is what you want; we do not support older 32bit or PowerPC based Macs.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.12-osx-unsigned.dmg](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v0.14.12/qtum-0.14.12-osx-unsigned.dmg) - A version of Qtum-Qt built for 64bit x86 machines using OSX in a .DMG installable format. If you use a modern Mac and aren't a developer, this is what you want; we do not support older 32bit or PowerPC based Macs.\r\n\r\n#### Linux\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.12-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v0.14.12/qtum-0.14.12-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 PC platforms running Linux. This is probably what you want for older computers running Linux\r\n* [qtum-0.14.12-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v0.14.12/qtum-0.14.12-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 PC platforms running Linux. This is probably what you want for any modern PC or server running Linux\r\n* [qtum-0.14.12-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v0.14.12/qtum-0.14.12-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz) - A version of qtumd and qtum-cli built for 32bit ARM platforms using Linux. This includes the Raspberry Pi and many of it's clones\r\n* [qtum-0.14.12-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v0.14.12/qtum-0.14.12-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of qtumd and qtum-cli built for 64bit ARM platforms using Linux\r\n\r\nBelow in the full list of binaries, there are also versions that include debug symbols. These are useful for developers, but will run slower and are significantly larger to download. \r\n\r\n#### Build Qtum Core\r\n\r\nIf you want to build it from source, it's recommended to follow the specific [\"build\" documentation](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/tree/testnet-2/doc) for your platform. But mostly it boils down to the following:\r\n\r\n1. Clone the qtum source code and cd into `qtum`\r\n\r\n        git clone --recursive https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum.git\r\n        cd qtum\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Build qtum-core:\r\n\r\n    Configure and build the headless qtum binaries as well as the GUI (if Qt is found).\r\n\r\n    You can disable the GUI build by passing `--without-gui` to configure.\r\n\r\n        ./autogen.sh\r\n        ./configure\r\n        make\r\n\r\n3.  It is recommended to build and run the unit tests to ensure everything is working correctly:\r\n\r\n        make check\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you encounter an error like:\r\n\r\n> make[2]: *** No rule to make target \u2018cpp-ethereum/utils/libscrypt/b64.c\u2019, needed by \u2018cpp-ethereum/utils/libscrypt/libbitcoinconsensus_la-b64.lo\u2019.  Stop.\r\n\r\nThen you did not checkout the cpp-ethereum submodule for Qtum. To do that, simply:\r\n\r\n    cd qtum\r\n    git submodule update --init --recursive\r\n\r\nValidate and Reproduce Binaries\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nQtum uses a tool called Gitian to make reproducible builds that can be verified by anyone. Instructions on setting up a Gitian VM and building Qtum are provided [in doc/gitian-building.md](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/blob/master/doc/gitian-building.md)\r\n\r\nCommunity Resources\r\n---------\r\n\r\nMake sure to check out these resources as well for more information and to keep up to date with all the latest news about Qtum. At least 1 developer is always around, so if you're developing on Qtum and need help, we'd love to welcome you to our community.  \r\n\r\n* [/r/Qtum on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/)\r\n* [Qtum Telegram Group](https://t.me/joinchat/D5oBaw29NeOdpw6qqqf2lw)\r\n* [@QtumOfficial on Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/qtumofficial)\r\n* [Qtum on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/QtumOfficial/)\r\n* [Qtum Forum](https://forum.qtum.org/)\r\n* [Qtum.org](https://qtum.org/en/)\r\n\r\n\r\nQtum Smart Contract Limitations\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n* EVM smart contracts can not receive coins from or send coins to any address type other than pay-to-pubkeyhash (starts with Q) addresses. This is due to a limitation in the EVM\r\n* Contracts are not allowed to create contracts with an initial endowment of coins. The contract must first be created, and then be sent coins in a separate transaction. Humans are also not allowed to create contracts with an initial endowment of coins.\r\n* Although all of the infrastructure is present, Qtum Core does not currently parse Solidity event data. You must parse this yourself using either `searchlogs` or `-record-log-opcodes` features.\r\n* It is not possible to send a contract coins without also executing the contract. This is also the case of Ethereum. This was promised in earlier discussions and technically does work, but due to lack of time for testing this feature was disabled. We hope to reenable this feature with release of the x86 virtual machine in 2018.\r\n* In Qtum there can be multiple addresses used to create a proof-of-stake block. However, the EVM can only see the first output using the `coinbase` operation in Solidity (this address is also the one registered for the continuous staker rewards after 500 blocks). \r\n\r\nHash Validation\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\r\nHash: SHA512\r\n\r\nIf you would like to validate that the binaries you download are exactly the same as those provided and built by the Qtum team, then you can compare your binaries to the following sha256sum hashes:\r\n\r\n3f200d9fc2edfb188b0d191505fb4750a36c199f4002fbfd5639ee43b725d6b9  qtum-0.14.12-osx-unsigned.dmg \r\nbe50c3623d4f1e9423ed2b84419fa7d293a3931ee429ce3ada1efe4a81d19658  qtum-0.14.12-osx-unsigned.tar.gz \r\n9c79a465cd2e1e0a61940e217e98d7be88369b1a6b7259064c8f63abc4b5367d  qtum-0.14.12-osx64.tar.gz \r\n32df22b9cca3442cee6b0c933347ea8ba103ef3aaa2a37693e9975dd7020f88f  src/qtum-0.14.12.tar.gz \r\naa88cfb81090276c9b6569fbda0a213475f71f380629becceb658ccffef6ecc5  qtum-osx-0.14-res.yml \r\n\r\n2b20f263d5c63902a8f1748a2b05a2e2e05f8a3b7d32a04291bc3846dc3a53b7  qtum-0.14.12-aarch64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\ndcc5fda0f54e180fdf8029442623c45c85d7de08fc9633b5769a632971be4806  qtum-0.14.12-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\nfa33f5ee5bac3d1225449d62173e73c4cc456de1b46c9c24d84cd539f8e6a0ee  qtum-0.14.12-arm-linux-gnueabihf-debug.tar.gz\r\n57701254f2b3f7eb5fe7619f2e614c90f739eee7aa3ab74603c06da11b74fdca  qtum-0.14.12-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz\r\ned27f7a55183069a43fd3fddd6f0706652de565acd36c76ff573a9fecbb802c8  qtum-0.14.12-i686-pc-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\nf329d0c5766977bbf4079e34bef710eb87fa9ebb076f089e534b03137fc39aad  qtum-0.14.12-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\n1a48b980aac389282d232cd7769c7297f4afe251ef9c8bb0ee847d33c6a53010  qtum-0.14.12-x86_64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\n5ccf9dd08327522fcc0d58ae5b53de6851d881c10967009048126eee07d5586b  qtum-0.14.12-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\n32df22b9cca3442cee6b0c933347ea8ba103ef3aaa2a37693e9975dd7020f88f  src/qtum-0.14.12.tar.gz\r\n3e724f5d2e810a2c2f2d3920ccf649ff02936a1df038f694dca0d1466b261605  qtum-linux-0.14-res.yml\r\n\r\n7ad107cfea42a9bd2e467c3c324865fb9aeb2a6cbb1222a98f007b60ee1626cd  qtum-0.14.12-win-unsigned.tar.gz \r\naa9a415041b9de6144b9fecfc425e8c8176095f3953c4e2b3004720867129752  qtum-0.14.12-win32-debug.zip \r\n881742ab8ab75c785499bc906be8328e9c4db62ca017259bfaf974d58c812a37  qtum-0.14.12-win32-setup-unsigned.exe \r\n4368fcc9cdc78b7020d68d5d61e00bd193ccd11c381d4c42947d17692249c431  qtum-0.14.12-win32.zip \r\n6648e27e99a1600727bd9a309bc24266f95059207ab37b3465adaf48b5b6157d  qtum-0.14.12-win64-debug.zip \r\nadd6b0ac97d47b2f18a93968685d8e070cd3533944e4cb64ef99e7debf44e468  qtum-0.14.12-win64-setup-unsigned.exe \r\n0485822fcd2c5018ea024a8397467a3a8025014f139167d70ee03a15d655ada1  qtum-0.14.12-win64.zip \r\na1076654cfe2c8269a577d614f542d3a913683b9cda0afe8db69310c223cd6fa  src/qtum-0.14.12.tar.gz \r\n7147d5cc17a48dcae7d11395ce82746e7908cb7029692a4bb8518550e92436cd  qtum-win-0.14-res.yml \r\n\r\nVirusTotal reports at time of release:\r\n\r\n* win32 installer: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/881742ab8ab75c785499bc906be8328e9c4db62ca017259bfaf974d58c812a37/detection\r\nKaspersky and ZoneAlarm reports \"HEUR:Trojan.Win32.Generic\"\r\nIkarus reports \"Trojan.MSIL.Disfa\"\r\nCylance reports \"Unsafe\"\r\n* win64 installer: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/add6b0ac97d47b2f18a93968685d8e070cd3533944e4cb64ef99e7debf44e468/detection\r\nKaspersky and ZoneAlarm reports \"HEUR:Trojan.Win32.Generic\"\r\n* win32 zip: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/4368fcc9cdc78b7020d68d5d61e00bd193ccd11c381d4c42947d17692249c431/detection\r\nKaspersky and ZoneAlarm reports \"HEUR:Trojan.Win32.Generic\"\r\nIkarus reports \"Trojan.MSIL.Disfa\"\r\n* win64 zip: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/0485822fcd2c5018ea024a8397467a3a8025014f139167d70ee03a15d655ada1/detection\r\nKaspersky and ZoneAlarm reports \"HEUR:Trojan.Win32.Generic\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can validate this message is from Earlz at https://keybase.io/verify\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: Keybase OpenPGP v2.0.76\r\nComment: https://keybase.io/crypto\r\n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\r\nEhsLrKNFFvKWZAHGOUgr\r\n=ihNI\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n```\r\n",

                "description": "About Qtum and Mainnet Ignition\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nQtum is a decentralized blockchain project built on Bitcoin's UTXO model, with support for Ethereum Virtual Machine based smart contracts, and secured by a proof of stake consensus model. It achieves this through the revolutionary Account Abstraction Layer which allows the EVM to communicate with Qtum's Bitcoin-like UTXO blockchain. For more general information about Qtum as well as links to join our community, go to https://qtum.org\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Qtum Ignition Main Network. This is the main network where the tokens hold value and should be guarded very carefully. There will be a testnet setup soon for developers, in the meantime you can use `-regtest` mode for testing needs. We will announce details about the token swap from QTUM ERC20 coins to QTUM mainnet tokens soon, watch our [website](https://qtum.org) for details about that.  \r\n\r\nThe major features implemented in Qtum Ignition include:\r\n\r\n1. The Ethereum Virtual Machine, which allows for compatibility with most existing Solidity based smart contracts.\r\n2. The Smart Staking Protocol is complete, which is an optimized Proof of Stake implementation designed for a smart contract platform (however, smart contracts can not participate in staking yet).\r\n3. An early and basic smart contract GUI has been implemented that can be used for creating contracts, sending data and Qtum to them, and checking their status by executing them locally. This functionality is similar to Mist's UI right now, but it is still an early version. We will be working on this more to improve it. \r\n4. Regtest mode, which is ideal for developers who wish to create their own private blockchain. It is tuned specifically to make development easier. It will stake blocks automatically every 30 seconds, and can generate proof-of-work blocks instantly as needed.\r\n5. The Decentralized Governance Protocol is completely implemented and functional, which allows certain network parameters to be modified without a fork.\r\n\r\nFor more technical information for how to start developing with Qtum please read the [Guide](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/blob/master/doc/sparknet-guide.md) and also see this tutorial for deploying a simple [faucet smart contract](http://earlz.net/view/2017/06/30/2144/the-qtum-sparknet-faucet) (it hasn't yet been updated for Mainnet for obvious reasons, but all the instructions are the same and you can try them in regtest mode)\r\n\r\nNote: Qtum Core is considered beta software. We make no warranties or guarantees of its security or stability.\r\n\r\nUpdate History\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n* v0.14.11 - Optional Update\r\n    * Changed our versioning scheme to be consistent and avoid the two version number confusion\r\n    * Add feature to restore wallet in the Qt wallet\r\n    * Add new RPC call \"waitforlogs\" that is particularly useful for Dapp developers\r\n    * Add long-polling support to the gettransaction RPC call\r\n* v1.1.4 - Recommended update\r\n    * Fixed a bug that would cause syncing to stop\r\n    * Fixed a bug that would cause the wallet to crash when using -logevents\r\n* v1.1.3 - Highly recommended update\r\n    * Fixed a bug that caused contact addresses to show in receive token address dropdown\r\n* v1.1.2 - Optional update, but recommended if using QRC tokens\r\n    * Fixed a bug with token transactions where the transaction ID displayed was incorrect in the Qt wallet\r\n    * Allow adding 0 balance addresses as the token receiver in the Qt wallet\r\n* v1.1.1: When sending to contracts, the sender address is now the default change address to reduce confusion; fix -salvagewallet so it works with token transactions\r\n* v1.1.0: Add GUI support Qtum QRC tokens, allowing full management of tokens on the Qtum blockchain from the Qt wallet\r\n    * Sending to a contract no longer requires ABI data, allowing easy participation in simple crowdsale contracts\r\n* v1.0.4: Fix bug where certain circumstances when staking could cause the displayed balance to be inaccurate until completely redownloading the blockchain.\r\n* v1.0.3: Fix staker bug that reported false messages; slightly increases staking performance; optimize staker parameters; fix white send button in GUI\r\n* v1.0.2: Various UI fixes, minor gas overflow consensus fix, per-txout exploit fix, testnet mode setup and functioning\r\n* v1.0.1: Fixed network magic bytes and minimum version to ensure the main network does not conflict with the Skynet network\r\n* v1.0: Initial release\r\n\r\nReindex Required When Upgrading from v1.0.1\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhen you first start the Qtum 1.0.2 GUI wallet after using Qtum v1.0.1 it will prompt you that it must reindex the database. This is normal and is a result of switching our internal database format from per-transaction to per-txout. If you use `qtumd -daemon` it will silently fail to start. You need to use `qtumd -daemon -reindex` in this case. \r\n\r\nQtum Documentation and Usage Resources\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nBasic usage resources:\r\n\r\n* [Official Qtum Usage Guide](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/wiki/Qtum-Wallet-Tutorial)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum staking tutorial](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/qtum-staking-tutorial-using-qtum-qt)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum staking tutorial on Raspberry Pi](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/qtum-staking-tutorial-using-qtumd-on-a-raspberry-pi-3)\r\n* [Unofficial guide for keeping your wallet safe](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/encrypting-backing-up-and-restoring-your-qtum-wallet)\r\n* [Block explorer](https://explorer.qtum.org)\r\n* [Unofficial block explorer](https://qtumexplorer.io/)\r\n* [Unofficial Raspberry Pi Web UI](https://github.com/rpiwalletui/qtum-ui)\r\n\r\nDevelopment resources:\r\n\r\n* [Deploying a custom token to Qtum](https://blog.qtum.org/qtum-custom-token-walkthrough-467d725fa27d)\r\n* [Early example faucet contract](http://earlz.net/view/2017/06/30/2144/the-qtum-sparknet-faucet)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum Hello World tutorial](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/quantum-qtum-blockchain-developer-tutorial-hello-world)\r\n\r\nGeneral Info about Qtum:\r\n\r\n* [Mainnet event AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/comments/6zs8t0/official_qtum_ama_thread_starts_at_10pm_beijing/)\r\n* [Qtum's PoS vs CASPER](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/comments/788oa5/qtums_pos_vs_casper_and_the_nothingatstake_problem/)\r\n* [Technical article explaining Qtum's PoS model in depth](http://earlz.net/view/2017/07/27/1904/the-missing-explanation-of-proof-of-stake-version)\r\n* [Unofficial What is Qtum article](https://storeofvalue.github.io/posts/what-is-qtum-without-the-bullshit/)\r\n\r\nQuickstart\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get started with Qtum is to simply download the binaries below. To give a brief breakdown of the different versions available: \r\n\r\n#### Windows\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.11-win64.zip](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v0.14.11/qtum-0.14.11-win64.zip) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using Windows.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.11-win64-setup-unsigned.exe](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v0.14.11/qtum-0.14.11-win64-setup-unsigned.exe) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using Windows.

If you have an older Windows computer and don't care about installing Qtum system-wide, \r\n* [qtum-0.14.11-win32-setup-unsigned.exe](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v0.14.11/qtum-0.14.11-win32-setup-unsigned.exe) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 machines using Windows. This includes an installer and will install Qtum system wide. If you have an older Windows computer and want to install Qtum then this is for you.\r\n\r\n#### OSX\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.11-osx64.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v0.14.11/qtum-0.14.11-osx64.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using OSX. If you use a modern Mac and want development tools, this is what you want; we do not support older 32bit or PowerPC based Macs.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.11-osx-unsigned.dmg](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v0.14.11/qtum-0.14.11-osx-unsigned.dmg) - A version of Qtum-Qt built for 64bit x86 machines using OSX in a .DMG installable format. If you use a modern Mac and aren't a developer, this is what you want; we do not support older 32bit or PowerPC based Macs.\r\n\r\n#### Linux\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.11-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v0.14.11/qtum-0.14.11-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 PC platforms running Linux. This is probably what you want for older computers running Linux\r\n* [qtum-0.14.11-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v0.14.11/qtum-0.14.11-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 PC platforms running Linux.

This includes the Raspberry Pi and many of it's clones\r\n* [qtum-0.14.11-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v0.14.11/qtum-0.14.11-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of qtumd and qtum-cli built for 64bit ARM platforms using Linux\r\n\r\nBelow in the full list of binaries, there are also versions that include debug symbols. These are useful for developers, but will run slower and are significantly larger to download. \r\n\r\n#### Build Qtum Core\r\n\r\nIf you want to build it from source, it's recommended to follow the specific [\"build\" documentation](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/tree/testnet-2/doc) for your platform. But mostly it boils down to the following:\r\n\r\n1. Clone the qtum source code and cd into `qtum`\r\n\r\n        git clone --recursive https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum.git\r\n        cd qtum\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Build qtum-core:\r\n\r\n    Configure and build the headless qtum binaries as well as the GUI (if Qt is found).\r\n\r\n    You can disable the GUI build by passing `--without-gui` to configure.\r\n\r\n        ./autogen.sh\r\n        ./configure\r\n        make\r\n\r\n3.  It is recommended to build and run the unit tests to ensure everything is working correctly:\r\n\r\n        make check\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you encounter an error like:\r\n\r\n> make[2]: *** No rule to make target \u2018cpp-ethereum/utils/libscrypt/b64.c\u2019, needed by \u2018cpp-ethereum/utils/libscrypt/libbitcoinconsensus_la-b64.lo\u2019.  Stop.\r\n\r\nThen you did not checkout the cpp-ethereum submodule for Qtum. To do that, simply:\r\n\r\n    cd qtum\r\n    git submodule update --init --recursive\r\n\r\nValidate and Reproduce Binaries\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nQtum uses a tool called Gitian to make reproducible builds that can be verified by anyone. Instructions on setting up a Gitian VM and building Qtum are provided [in doc/gitian-building.md](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/blob/master/doc/gitian-building.md)\r\n\r\nCommunity Resources\r\n---------\r\n\r\nMake sure to check out these resources as well for more information and to keep up to date with all the latest news about Qtum. At least 1 developer is always around, so if you're developing on Qtum and need help, we'd love to welcome you to our community.  \r\n\r\n* [/r/Qtum on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/)\r\n* [Qtum Telegram Group](https://t.me/joinchat/D5oBaw29NeOdpw6qqqf2lw)\r\n* [@QtumOfficial on Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/qtumofficial)\r\n* [Qtum on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/QtumOfficial/)\r\n* [Qtum Forum](https://forum.qtum.org/)\r\n* [Qtum.org](https://qtum.org/en/)\r\n\r\n\r\nQtum Smart Contract Limitations\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n* EVM smart contracts can not receive coins from or send coins to any address type other than pay-to-pubkeyhash (starts with Q) addresses. This is due to a limitation in the EVM\r\n* Contracts are not allowed to create contracts with an initial endowment of coins. The contract must first be created, and then be sent coins in a separate transaction. Humans are also not allowed to create contracts with an initial endowment of coins.\r\n* Although all of the infrastructure is present, Qtum Core does not currently parse Solidity event data. You must parse this yourself using either `searchlogs` or `-record-log-opcodes` features.\r\n* It is not possible to send a contract coins without also executing the contract. This is also the case of Ethereum. This was promised in earlier discussions and technically does work, but due to lack of time for testing this feature was disabled. We hope to reenable this feature with release of the x86 virtual machine in 2018.\r\n* In Qtum there can be multiple addresses used to create a proof-of-stake block. However, the EVM can only see the first output using the `coinbase` operation in Solidity (this address is also the one registered for the continuous staker rewards after 500 blocks). \r\n\r\nHash Validation\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\r\nHash: SHA512\r\n\r\nIf you would like to validate that the binaries you download are exactly the same as those provided and built by the Qtum team, then you can compare your binaries to the following sha256sum hashes:\r\n\r\n9b656b92b3e63166a29218abca7603d0fac8d46d980b7ebcdcf597e36f442352  qtum-0.14.11-osx-unsigned.dmg\r\nda9953d39f7ab578d4273b15c5fe76be3d2ea7761a690e7e5257dbb937dde678  qtum-0.14.11-osx-unsigned.tar.gz\r\n18ac0c65d723328775daf9117fa94c9857e6f65c3b570bc6c4d8df1e58f0a6ff  qtum-0.14.11-osx64.tar.gz\r\ndb2824f6d548f30dab4ea7d8a7d4997a3b4c6ced7430d65a2347eecd9839a557  src/qtum-0.14.11.tar.gz\r\n2abe387460d6e0ef323a1d814216d346ba26e1cc645add7868bdd587ed32b851  qtum-osx-0.14-res.yml\r\n\r\n202d97db33c484c142e46af9bc6bc88b2c147ee1ca6467cdf3ec9b5f291c7354  qtum-0.14.11-aarch64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\n89d0afae3580f91c6cf2e6c85473925203928bdee0e76496e57a31b250d02df8  qtum-0.14.11-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\n6ab2d589941508adeec5854f17daf30c7b8a0f43015ddb554a704082127b69f0  qtum-0.14.11-arm-linux-gnueabihf-debug.tar.gz\r\ndd4a97a0cabd7215029313d85e0b01efdfad632a44116e0031f2ff8a4dde596e  qtum-0.14.11-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz\r\n1eeee104ef84334ee276b3d228d736ef8556e6964eeed532c8413074c6584a4f  qtum-0.14.11-i686-pc-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\n4f9bfd1c205a700c3924647df3a7a8afd6e9f5c9b89f21aa9d974169acafe22d  qtum-0.14.11-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\n123d189a04492b495f2d69c4311ae4c06b3eaa830fb3c2c5521dea15079768ab  qtum-0.14.11-x86_64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\n6b434a70656f3a1a95021b97209d6b485e32948c757ad0cadaac0e45995359df  qtum-0.14.11-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\ndb2824f6d548f30dab4ea7d8a7d4997a3b4c6ced7430d65a2347eecd9839a557  src/qtum-0.14.11.tar.gz\r\nb571d7fb92c0c5b6a1b37ba1660163550edae509b0a524921a3707f5603a9aa3  qtum-linux-0.14-res.yml\r\n\r\n33ef7ded8a060e01bcd5ac4fac619c67d29ca9fd45c238015ba534f27949aac5  qtum-0.14.11-win-unsigned.tar.gz\r\n872327e280c8dc9e65c38ae06b59a22bcff5cf21df48b825ed5e5afbac6a4981  qtum-0.14.11-win32-debug.zip\r\n2250938417681f1f6b119f14b08973defb395481bb1b6c65753c1a2272a8a00a  qtum-0.14.11-win32-setup-unsigned.exe\r\n5647d2a01892a3cafcc169203cfc83d2a2541f20f5ef2f90042ae9182f683dd9  qtum-0.14.11-win32.zip\r\n0860c06796f0ffdfad498eba7586684dbf38bd4af26ae8b305b8d90f7e6808b4  qtum-0.14.11-win64-debug.zip\r\n29c24b5ea68257e5ffe29cb43cd184916a340c7b570d699207bd721978fc95be  qtum-0.14.11-win64-setup-unsigned.exe\r\nf43e8ad60fcde9ba6d0990fc4718b2d96ea1860a1fc5d225baf7ae64c95e8b5b  qtum-0.14.11-win64.zip\r\nd783d6ac106b2096d1a2c5b950f2e1ccf371ec0622aa7b4904a3aa3a9062378b  src/qtum-0.14.11.tar.gz\r\n26e76937e92afe48d3884da65f8bddc451a9bcf15fb7a571fb68a5b8894a58db  qtum-win-0.14-res.yml\r\n\r\nIn addition, as of the time of this writing, VirusTotal detects 2 false positives on all 32-bit and 64-bit Windows files labeled \"HEUR:Trojan.Win32.Generic\" from vendors Kaspersky and ZoneAlarm.\r\n\r\ninstaller win32: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/2250938417681f1f6b119f14b08973defb395481bb1b6c65753c1a2272a8a00a/detection\r\n\r\ninstaller win64 https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/29c24b5ea68257e5ffe29cb43cd184916a340c7b570d699207bd721978fc95be/detection\r\n\r\nzip win32 https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/5647d2a01892a3cafcc169203cfc83d2a2541f20f5ef2f90042ae9182f683dd9/detection\r\n\r\nzip win64 https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/f43e8ad60fcde9ba6d0990fc4718b2d96ea1860a1fc5d225baf7ae64c95e8b5b/detection\r\n\r\nYou can validate this message is from Earlz at https://keybase.io/verify\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: Keybase OpenPGP v2.0.76\r\nComment: https://keybase.io/crypto\r\n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\r\n+pZH3rS0AqetT7eMl6Kb\r\n=hglx\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n```",

                "description": "About Qtum and Mainnet Ignition\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nQtum is a decentralized blockchain project built on Bitcoin's UTXO model, with support for Ethereum Virtual Machine based smart contracts, and secured by a proof of stake consensus model. It achieves this through the revolutionary Account Abstraction Layer which allows the EVM to communicate with Qtum's Bitcoin-like UTXO blockchain. For more general information about Qtum as well as links to join our community, go to https://qtum.org\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Qtum Ignition Main Network. This is the main network where the tokens hold value and should be guarded very carefully. There will be a testnet setup soon for developers, in the meantime you can use `-regtest` mode for testing needs. We will announce details about the token swap from QTUM ERC20 coins to QTUM mainnet tokens soon, watch our [website](https://qtum.org) for details about that.  \r\n\r\nThe major features implemented in Qtum Ignition include:\r\n\r\n1. The Ethereum Virtual Machine, which allows for compatibility with most existing Solidity based smart contracts.\r\n2. The Smart Staking Protocol is complete, which is an optimized Proof of Stake implementation designed for a smart contract platform (however, smart contracts can not participate in staking yet).\r\n3. An early and basic smart contract GUI has been implemented that can be used for creating contracts, sending data and Qtum to them, and checking their status by executing them locally. This functionality is similar to Mist's UI right now, but it is still an early version. We will be working on this more to improve it. \r\n4. Regtest mode, which is ideal for developers who wish to create their own private blockchain. It is tuned specifically to make development easier. It will stake blocks automatically every 30 seconds, and can generate proof-of-work blocks instantly as needed.\r\n5. The Decentralized Governance Protocol is completely implemented and functional, which allows certain network parameters to be modified without a fork.\r\n\r\nFor more technical information for how to start developing with Qtum please read the [Guide](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/blob/master/doc/sparknet-guide.md) and also see this tutorial for deploying a simple [faucet smart contract](http://earlz.net/view/2017/06/30/2144/the-qtum-sparknet-faucet) (it hasn't yet been updated for Mainnet for obvious reasons, but all the instructions are the same and you can try them in regtest mode)\r\n\r\nNote: Qtum Core is considered beta software. We make no warranties or guarantees of its security or stability.\r\n\r\nUpdate History\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n* v1.1.4 - Recommended update\r\n    * Fixed a bug that would cause syncing to stop\r\n    * Fixed a bug that would cause the wallet to crash when using -logevents\r\n* v1.1.3 - Highly recommended update\r\n    * Fixed a bug that caused contact addresses to show in receive token address dropdown\r\n* v1.1.2 - Optional update, but recommended if using QRC tokens\r\n    * Fixed a bug with token transactions where the transaction ID displayed was incorrect in the Qt wallet\r\n    * Allow adding 0 balance addresses as the token receiver in the Qt wallet\r\n* v1.1.1: When sending to contracts, the sender address is now the default change address to reduce confusion; fix -salvagewallet so it works with token transactions\r\n* v1.1.0: Add GUI support Qtum QRC tokens, allowing full management of tokens on the Qtum blockchain from the Qt wallet\r\n    * Sending to a contract no longer requires ABI data, allowing easy participation in simple crowdsale contracts\r\n* v1.0.4: Fix bug where certain circumstances when staking could cause the displayed balance to be inaccurate until completely redownloading the blockchain.\r\n* v1.0.3: Fix staker bug that reported false messages; slightly increases staking performance; optimize staker parameters; fix white send button in GUI\r\n* v1.0.2: Various UI fixes, minor gas overflow consensus fix, per-txout exploit fix, testnet mode setup and functioning\r\n* v1.0.1: Fixed network magic bytes and minimum version to ensure the main network does not conflict with the Skynet network\r\n* v1.0: Initial release\r\n\r\nReindex Required When Upgrading from v1.0.1\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhen you first start the Qtum 1.0.2 GUI wallet after using Qtum v1.0.1 it will prompt you that it must reindex the database. This is normal and is a result of switching our internal database format from per-transaction to per-txout. If you use `qtumd -daemon` it will silently fail to start. You need to use `qtumd -daemon -reindex` in this case. \r\n\r\nQtum Documentation and Usage Resources\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nBasic usage resources:\r\n\r\n* [Official Qtum Usage Guide](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/wiki/Qtum-Wallet-Tutorial)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum staking tutorial](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/qtum-staking-tutorial-using-qtum-qt)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum staking tutorial on Raspberry Pi](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/qtum-staking-tutorial-using-qtumd-on-a-raspberry-pi-3)\r\n* [Unofficial guide for keeping your wallet safe](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/encrypting-backing-up-and-restoring-your-qtum-wallet)\r\n* [Block explorer](https://explorer.qtum.org)\r\n* [Unofficial block explorer](https://qtumexplorer.io/)\r\n* [Unofficial Raspberry Pi Web UI](https://github.com/rpiwalletui/qtum-ui)\r\n\r\nDevelopment resources:\r\n\r\n* [Deploying a custom token to Qtum](https://blog.qtum.org/qtum-custom-token-walkthrough-467d725fa27d)\r\n* [Early example faucet contract](http://earlz.net/view/2017/06/30/2144/the-qtum-sparknet-faucet)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum Hello World tutorial](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/quantum-qtum-blockchain-developer-tutorial-hello-world)\r\n\r\nGeneral Info about Qtum:\r\n\r\n* [Mainnet event AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/comments/6zs8t0/official_qtum_ama_thread_starts_at_10pm_beijing/)\r\n* [Qtum's PoS vs CASPER](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/comments/788oa5/qtums_pos_vs_casper_and_the_nothingatstake_problem/)\r\n* [Technical article explaining Qtum's PoS model in depth](http://earlz.net/view/2017/07/27/1904/the-missing-explanation-of-proof-of-stake-version)\r\n* [Unofficial What is Qtum article](https://storeofvalue.github.io/posts/what-is-qtum-without-the-bullshit/)\r\n\r\nQuickstart\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get started with Qtum is to simply download the binaries below. To give a brief breakdown of the different versions available: \r\n\r\n#### Windows\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.10-win64.zip](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.4/qtum-0.14.10-win64.zip) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using Windows.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.10-win64-setup-unsigned.exe](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.4/qtum-0.14.10-win64-setup-unsigned.exe) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using Windows.

If you have an older Windows computer and don't care about installing Qtum system-wide, \r\n* [qtum-0.14.10-win32-setup-unsigned.exe](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.4/qtum-0.14.10-win32-setup-unsigned.exe) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 machines using Windows. This includes an installer and will install Qtum system wide. If you have an older Windows computer and want to install Qtum then this is for you.\r\n\r\n#### OSX\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.10-osx64.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.4/qtum-0.14.10-osx64.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using OSX. If you use a modern Mac and want development tools, this is what you want; we do not support older 32bit or PowerPC based Macs.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.10-osx-unsigned.dmg](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.4/qtum-0.14.10-osx-unsigned.dmg) - A version of Qtum-Qt built for 64bit x86 machines using OSX in a .DMG installable format. If you use a modern Mac and aren't a developer, this is what you want; we do not support older 32bit or PowerPC based Macs.\r\n\r\n#### Linux\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.10-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.4/qtum-0.14.10-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 PC platforms running Linux. This is probably what you want for older computers running Linux\r\n* [qtum-0.14.10-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.4/qtum-0.14.10-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 PC platforms running Linux. This is probably what you want for any modern PC or server running Linux\r\n* [qtum-0.14.10-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.4/qtum-0.14.10-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz) - A version of qtumd and qtum-cli built for 32bit ARM platforms using Linux. This includes the Raspberry Pi and many of it's clones\r\n* [qtum-0.14.10-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.4/qtum-0.14.10-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of qtumd and qtum-cli built for 64bit ARM platforms using Linux\r\n\r\nBelow in the full list of binaries, there are also versions that include debug symbols. These are useful for developers, but will run slower and are significantly larger to download. \r\n\r\n#### Build Qtum Core\r\n\r\nIf you want to build it from source, it's recommended to follow the specific [\"build\" documentation](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/tree/testnet-2/doc) for your platform. But mostly it boils down to the following:\r\n\r\n1. Clone the qtum source code and cd into `qtum`\r\n\r\n        git clone --recursive https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum.git\r\n        cd qtum\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Build qtum-core:\r\n\r\n    Configure and build the headless qtum binaries as well as the GUI (if Qt is found).\r\n\r\n    You can disable the GUI build by passing `--without-gui` to configure.\r\n\r\n        ./autogen.sh\r\n        ./configure\r\n        make\r\n\r\n3.  It is recommended to build and run the unit tests to ensure everything is working correctly:\r\n\r\n        make check\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you encounter an error like:\r\n\r\n> make[2]: *** No rule to make target \u2018cpp-ethereum/utils/libscrypt/b64.c\u2019, needed by \u2018cpp-ethereum/utils/libscrypt/libbitcoinconsensus_la-b64.lo\u2019.  Stop.\r\n\r\nThen you did not checkout the cpp-ethereum submodule for Qtum. To do that, simply:\r\n\r\n    cd qtum\r\n    git submodule update --init --recursive\r\n\r\nValidate and Reproduce Binaries\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nQtum uses a tool called Gitian to make reproducible builds that can be verified by anyone. Instructions on setting up a Gitian VM and building Qtum are provided [in doc/gitian-building.md](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/blob/master/doc/gitian-building.md)\r\n\r\nCommunity Resources\r\n---------\r\n\r\nMake sure to check out these resources as well for more information and to keep up to date with all the latest news about Qtum. At least 1 developer is always around, so if you're developing on Qtum and need help, we'd love to welcome you to our community.  \r\n\r\n* [/r/Qtum on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/)\r\n* [Qtum Telegram Group](https://t.me/joinchat/D5oBaw29NeOdpw6qqqf2lw)\r\n* [@QtumOfficial on Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/qtumofficial)\r\n* [Qtum on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/QtumOfficial/)\r\n* [Qtum Forum](https://forum.qtum.org/)\r\n* [Qtum.org](https://qtum.org/en/)\r\n\r\n\r\nQtum Smart Contract Limitations\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n* EVM smart contracts can not receive coins from or send coins to any address type other than pay-to-pubkeyhash (starts with Q) addresses. This is due to a limitation in the EVM\r\n* Contracts are not allowed to create contracts with an initial endowment of coins. The contract must first be created, and then be sent coins in a separate transaction. Humans are also not allowed to create contracts with an initial endowment of coins.\r\n* Although all of the infrastructure is present, Qtum Core does not currently parse Solidity event data. You must parse this yourself using either `searchlogs` or `-record-log-opcodes` features.\r\n* It is not possible to send a contract coins without also executing the contract. This is also the case of Ethereum. This was promised in earlier discussions and technically does work, but due to lack of time for testing this feature was disabled. We hope to reenable this feature with release of the x86 virtual machine in 2018.\r\n* In Qtum there can be multiple addresses used to create a proof-of-stake block. However, the EVM can only see the first output using the `coinbase` operation in Solidity (this address is also the one registered for the continuous staker rewards after 500 blocks). \r\n\r\nHash Validation\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\r\nHash: SHA512\r\n\r\nIf you would like to validate that the binaries you download are exactly the same as those provided and built by the Qtum team, then you can compare your binaries to the following sha256sum hashes:\r\n\r\n7d80c7a78f31820a99fa3fd388cc9ae505894b434a5810b7950f0258448f385a  qtum-0.14.10-osx-unsigned.dmg \r\n9dc34819ed8996906c46a807d872ac2fa053d7f508cde5ee1cca1ed1cac1d49b  qtum-0.14.10-osx-unsigned.tar.gz \r\na6e45b6de088a741e3b5bbc6fe21d1739355ce0d7bb2b5ae32957043d49406dc  qtum-0.14.10-osx64.tar.gz \r\nc6ea89eed1a3e4735a36c3d30eb7504ff9b48fde1a4485222cc81509d2526c01  src/qtum-0.14.10.tar.gz \r\n26e6468cd06ce84c91932dd3627a884baaa73ca6eacaa19fe8677ceeb4ea95b6  qtum-osx-0.14-res.yml \r\n\r\nddcd077a95de8016396b131eba8fde1c04576eb1987215e3aff796a6ad0018f2  qtum-0.14.10-aarch64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\n4bcd3b5fc5e26deaab08b21f5c721e0cb983b110e8c2253180459d5fc77628ca  qtum-0.14.10-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\nb11f122b98c2813992b77b2dca84feaea93c31e95d0d209293d5345416ab5c0d  qtum-0.14.10-arm-linux-gnueabihf-debug.tar.gz\r\n996819e47fc6db09b989ec2f7aff5b8bcf14903b6279548f040c41f1fe94cf87  qtum-0.14.10-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz\r\n8439f1dd8acddfa567e4bdc43717ffcd82cfa911ab6734775ef207be408bc401  qtum-0.14.10-i686-pc-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\na6855ad8cdb4d67e0224376f16abd4c37c3c37b00db449371773fa7e8caa3fe3  qtum-0.14.10-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\n9f23b28e2c02488f97f07eda4318af46a2414d1c2881bbcaaecfc5f2133a10f0  qtum-0.14.10-x86_64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\n76e3326086c3209c938a216b455a86d0bc10f6f667cefa3a19ab367d3b784f4f  qtum-0.14.10-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\nc6ea89eed1a3e4735a36c3d30eb7504ff9b48fde1a4485222cc81509d2526c01  src/qtum-0.14.10.tar.gz\r\ncfe96bad26dc48609c722583d0ae18bab0ebb53436bf6845e5bb7cc5d4188187  qtum-linux-0.14-res.yml\r\n\r\n43756f9f471f28d2e9d51610adb114c909360df3c0f4a5adde124541ef22fd62  qtum-0.14.10-win-unsigned.tar.gz \r\n0509f270098c613331da83ee72477c5db0f912e33babd2a534a526e0311f3ddd  qtum-0.14.10-win32-debug.zip \r\n06dbc7d464aeaed3510c3d5c23c0850d7e254037defdb0b7011f7711b2efc4b6  qtum-0.14.10-win32-setup-unsigned.exe \r\n5435f65bb7ad249f978a5a88ef5a630e02ae4639a72d096cd3f070cbdde9cafc  qtum-0.14.10-win32.zip \r\n8075b3d33b5fa01f006de7172b4b113cc7d1a0b4bc567331274fecd628a2fee7  qtum-0.14.10-win64-debug.zip \r\nf4d13a89c26a29194139c7b244d89e252dd3004f42d62784fe14b6fc48c646ea  qtum-0.14.10-win64-setup-unsigned.exe \r\n8a8c4b4affe662c90da23097c105f070ccd147be92a1e90669e1f14a4ff146a9  qtum-0.14.10-win64.zip \r\n20e927279b955a545d693502938ab79a46773388bb85de98e8862949daefbeee  src/qtum-0.14.10.tar.gz \r\n610296baec0beee09839893d75240ee0a15305708d6d4786ac326a9381c0a148  qtum-win-0.14-res.yml \r\n\r\nIn addition, as of the time of this writing, VirusTotal detects 2 false positives on all 32-bit Windows files, and 2 false positives on all 64-bit Windows files.

                "description": "About Qtum and Mainnet Ignition\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nQtum is a decentralized blockchain project built on Bitcoin's UTXO model, with support for Ethereum Virtual Machine based smart contracts, and secured by a proof of stake consensus model. It achieves this through the revolutionary Account Abstraction Layer which allows the EVM to communicate with Qtum's Bitcoin-like UTXO blockchain. For more general information about Qtum as well as links to join our community, go to https://qtum.org\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Qtum Ignition Main Network. This is the main network where the tokens hold value and should be guarded very carefully. There will be a testnet setup soon for developers, in the meantime you can use `-regtest` mode for testing needs. We will announce details about the token swap from QTUM ERC20 coins to QTUM mainnet tokens soon, watch our [website](https://qtum.org) for details about that.  \r\n\r\nThe major features implemented in Qtum Ignition include:\r\n\r\n1. The Ethereum Virtual Machine, which allows for compatibility with most existing Solidity based smart contracts.\r\n2. The Smart Staking Protocol is complete, which is an optimized Proof of Stake implementation designed for a smart contract platform (however, smart contracts can not participate in staking yet).\r\n3. An early and basic smart contract GUI has been implemented that can be used for creating contracts, sending data and Qtum to them, and checking their status by executing them locally. This functionality is similar to Mist's UI right now, but it is still an early version. We will be working on this more to improve it. \r\n4. Regtest mode, which is ideal for developers who wish to create their own private blockchain. It is tuned specifically to make development easier. It will stake blocks automatically every 30 seconds, and can generate proof-of-work blocks instantly as needed.\r\n5. The Decentralized Governance Protocol is completely implemented and functional, which allows certain network parameters to be modified without a fork.\r\n\r\nFor more technical information for how to start developing with Qtum please read the [Guide](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/blob/master/doc/sparknet-guide.md) and also see this tutorial for deploying a simple [faucet smart contract](http://earlz.net/view/2017/06/30/2144/the-qtum-sparknet-faucet) (it hasn't yet been updated for Mainnet for obvious reasons, but all the instructions are the same and you can try them in regtest mode)\r\n\r\nNote: Qtum Core is considered beta software. We make no warranties or guarantees of its security or stability.\r\n\r\nUpdate History\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n* v1.1.3 - Highly recommended update\r\n    * Fixed a bug that caused contact addresses to show in receive token address dropdown\r\n* v1.1.2 - Optional update, but recommended if using QRC tokens\r\n    * Fixed a bug with token transactions where the transaction ID displayed was incorrect in the Qt wallet\r\n    * Allow adding 0 balance addresses as the token receiver in the Qt wallet\r\n* v1.1.1: When sending to contracts, the sender address is now the default change address to reduce confusion; fix -salvagewallet so it works with token transactions\r\n* v1.1.0: Add GUI support Qtum QRC tokens, allowing full management of tokens on the Qtum blockchain from the Qt wallet\r\n    * Sending to a contract no longer requires ABI data, allowing easy participation in simple crowdsale contracts\r\n* v1.0.4: Fix bug where certain circumstances when staking could cause the displayed balance to be inaccurate until completely redownloading the blockchain.\r\n* v1.0.3: Fix staker bug that reported false messages; slightly increases staking performance; optimize staker parameters; fix white send button in GUI\r\n* v1.0.2: Various UI fixes, minor gas overflow consensus fix, per-txout exploit fix, testnet mode setup and functioning\r\n* v1.0.1: Fixed network magic bytes and minimum version to ensure the main network does not conflict with the Skynet network\r\n* v1.0: Initial release\r\n\r\nReindex Required When Upgrading from v1.0.1\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhen you first start the Qtum 1.0.2 GUI wallet after using Qtum v1.0.1 it will prompt you that it must reindex the database. This is normal and is a result of switching our internal database format from per-transaction to per-txout. If you use `qtumd -daemon` it will silently fail to start. You need to use `qtumd -daemon -reindex` in this case. \r\n\r\nQtum Documentation and Usage Resources\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nBasic usage resources:\r\n\r\n* [Official Qtum Usage Guide](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/wiki/Qtum-Wallet-Tutorial)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum staking tutorial](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/qtum-staking-tutorial-using-qtum-qt)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum staking tutorial on Raspberry Pi](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/qtum-staking-tutorial-using-qtumd-on-a-raspberry-pi-3)\r\n* [Unofficial guide for keeping your wallet safe](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/encrypting-backing-up-and-restoring-your-qtum-wallet)\r\n* [Block explorer](https://explorer.qtum.org)\r\n* [Unofficial block explorer](https://qtumexplorer.io/)\r\n* [Unofficial Raspberry Pi Web UI](https://github.com/rpiwalletui/qtum-ui)\r\n\r\nDevelopment resources:\r\n\r\n* [Deploying a custom token to Qtum](https://blog.qtum.org/qtum-custom-token-walkthrough-467d725fa27d)\r\n* [Early example faucet contract](http://earlz.net/view/2017/06/30/2144/the-qtum-sparknet-faucet)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum Hello World tutorial](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/quantum-qtum-blockchain-developer-tutorial-hello-world)\r\n\r\nGeneral Info about Qtum:\r\n\r\n* [Mainnet event AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/comments/6zs8t0/official_qtum_ama_thread_starts_at_10pm_beijing/)\r\n* [Qtum's PoS vs CASPER](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/comments/788oa5/qtums_pos_vs_casper_and_the_nothingatstake_problem/)\r\n* [Technical article explaining Qtum's PoS model in depth](http://earlz.net/view/2017/07/27/1904/the-missing-explanation-of-proof-of-stake-version)\r\n* [Unofficial What is Qtum article](https://storeofvalue.github.io/posts/what-is-qtum-without-the-bullshit/)\r\n\r\nQuickstart\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get started with Qtum is to simply download the binaries below. To give a brief breakdown of the different versions available: \r\n\r\n#### Windows\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.9-win64.zip](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.3/qtum-0.14.9-win64.zip) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using Windows.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.9-win64-setup-unsigned.exe](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.3/qtum-0.14.9-win64-setup-unsigned.exe) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using Windows.

If you have an older Windows computer and don't care about installing Qtum system-wide, \r\n* [qtum-0.14.9-win32-setup-unsigned.exe](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.3/qtum-0.14.9-win32-setup-unsigned.exe) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 machines using Windows. This includes an installer and will install Qtum system wide. If you have an older Windows computer and want to install Qtum then this is for you.\r\n\r\n#### OSX\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.9-osx64.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.3/qtum-0.14.9-osx64.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using OSX. If you use a modern Mac and want development tools, this is what you want; we do not support older 32bit or PowerPC based Macs.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.9-osx-unsigned.dmg](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.3/qtum-0.14.9-osx-unsigned.dmg) - A version of Qtum-Qt built for 64bit x86 machines using OSX in a .DMG installable format. If you use a modern Mac and aren't a developer, this is what you want; we do not support older 32bit or PowerPC based Macs.\r\n\r\n#### Linux\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.9-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.3/qtum-0.14.9-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 PC platforms running Linux. This is probably what you want for older computers running Linux\r\n* [qtum-0.14.9-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.3/qtum-0.14.9-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 PC platforms running Linux. This is probably what you want for any modern PC or server running Linux\r\n* [qtum-0.14.9-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.3/qtum-0.14.9-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz) - A version of qtumd and qtum-cli built for 32bit ARM platforms using Linux. This includes the Raspberry Pi and many of it's clones\r\n* [qtum-0.14.9-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.3/qtum-0.14.9-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of qtumd and qtum-cli built for 64bit ARM platforms using Linux\r\n\r\nBelow in the full list of binaries, there are also versions that include debug symbols. These are useful for developers, but will run slower and are significantly larger to download. \r\n\r\n#### Build Qtum Core\r\n\r\nIf you want to build it from source, it's recommended to follow the specific [\"build\" documentation](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/tree/testnet-2/doc) for your platform. But mostly it boils down to the following:\r\n\r\n1. Clone the qtum source code and cd into `qtum`\r\n\r\n        git clone --recursive https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum.git\r\n        cd qtum\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Build qtum-core:\r\n\r\n    Configure and build the headless qtum binaries as well as the GUI (if Qt is found).\r\n\r\n    You can disable the GUI build by passing `--without-gui` to configure.\r\n\r\n        ./autogen.sh\r\n        ./configure\r\n        make\r\n\r\n3.  It is recommended to build and run the unit tests to ensure everything is working correctly:\r\n\r\n        make check\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you encounter an error like:\r\n\r\n> make[2]: *** No rule to make target \u2018cpp-ethereum/utils/libscrypt/b64.c\u2019, needed by \u2018cpp-ethereum/utils/libscrypt/libbitcoinconsensus_la-b64.lo\u2019.  Stop.\r\n\r\nThen you did not checkout the cpp-ethereum submodule for Qtum. To do that, simply:\r\n\r\n    cd qtum\r\n    git submodule update --init --recursive\r\n\r\nValidate and Reproduce Binaries\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nQtum uses a tool called Gitian to make reproducible builds that can be verified by anyone. Instructions on setting up a Gitian VM and building Qtum are provided [in doc/gitian-building.md](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/blob/master/doc/gitian-building.md)\r\n\r\nCommunity Resources\r\n---------\r\n\r\nMake sure to check out these resources as well for more information and to keep up to date with all the latest news about Qtum. At least 1 developer is always around, so if you're developing on Qtum and need help, we'd love to welcome you to our community.  \r\n\r\n* [/r/Qtum on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/)\r\n* [Qtum Telegram Group](https://t.me/joinchat/D5oBaw29NeOdpw6qqqf2lw)\r\n* [@QtumOfficial on Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/qtumofficial)\r\n* [Qtum on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/QtumOfficial/)\r\n* [Qtum Forum](https://forum.qtum.org/)\r\n* [Qtum.org](https://qtum.org/en/)\r\n\r\n\r\nQtum Smart Contract Limitations\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n* EVM smart contracts can not receive coins from or send coins to any address type other than pay-to-pubkeyhash (starts with Q) addresses. This is due to a limitation in the EVM\r\n* Contracts are not allowed to create contracts with an initial endowment of coins. The contract must first be created, and then be sent coins in a separate transaction. Humans are also not allowed to create contracts with an initial endowment of coins.\r\n* Although all of the infrastructure is present, Qtum Core does not currently parse Solidity event data. You must parse this yourself using either `searchlogs` or `-record-log-opcodes` features.\r\n* It is not possible to send a contract coins without also executing the contract. This is also the case of Ethereum. This was promised in earlier discussions and technically does work, but due to lack of time for testing this feature was disabled. We hope to reenable this feature with release of the x86 virtual machine in 2018.\r\n* In Qtum there can be multiple addresses used to create a proof-of-stake block. However, the EVM can only see the first output using the `coinbase` operation in Solidity (this address is also the one registered for the continuous staker rewards after 500 blocks). \r\n\r\nHash Validation\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\r\nHash: SHA512\r\n\r\nIf you would like to validate that the binaries you download are exactly the same as those provided and built by the Qtum team, then you can compare your binaries to the following sha256sum hashes:\r\n\r\n73598fba4975982a7884d41228eec9a9152256284cf9b2d596680924d84a5ad4  qtum-0.14.9-osx-unsigned.dmg\r\n45a6a3306957a9bc1fe029e6883892b8db4b4f7772309317ce071f43b6e26692  qtum-0.14.9-osx-unsigned.tar.gz\r\n26d38eb7f0530c19e2b741e37badb2ad727a27988e33477513b780cd4dab83b9  qtum-0.14.9-osx64.tar.gz\r\nc3bc06f157b841b570ae6d9a101df457018f659b54668c8f8312aad9ac890ce5  src/qtum-0.14.9.tar.gz\r\n8989d503b96677036ec0b77471aa244f054fe1cdceaf4308adec9ae9ae100c9e  qtum-osx-0.14-res.yml\r\n\r\nb2b921ede8d3ddcb116f74afa22fc4c03b25deccb6b229cfd87727dde4f98098  qtum-0.14.9-aarch64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz \r\n28dca1df9b3fef1e2efcea5e3e3bdb4fd12c44cf2daf906e2f11a3c5680b3ec0  qtum-0.14.9-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz \r\n5177e144f19070102634462d4b7b0ec4aac0170c6340f859469e5594f976eff9  qtum-0.14.9-arm-linux-gnueabihf-debug.tar.gz \r\nca8a9f5212d874a008598dbd33af458c9f021ec9d5543ad47070dd195d4f1d26  qtum-0.14.9-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz \r\n35dc10292e941a9ec7f9c3163956d0e44b5d24d1bbe6ddc77727eb04059f136e  qtum-0.14.9-i686-pc-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz \r\n15a018c5a7935ebb9e5df43c6df35ab305da225ff7aff0bc2d2b8fd56277b7a6  qtum-0.14.9-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz \r\n215a0dc89761317905df1b1abc292728d06acfbfad6a739f8c2dd2d947324c13  qtum-0.14.9-x86_64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz \r\nda14fb65a4309ef7e0bd4c93d0cdd156d01e9f4774db481b46103275a8a19ce0  qtum-0.14.9-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz \r\nc3bc06f157b841b570ae6d9a101df457018f659b54668c8f8312aad9ac890ce5  src/qtum-0.14.9.tar.gz \r\n5d45dd739ed7cce060d06ef29c9c5f641db5c034331b07142a475cf7ec5ba1ca  qtum-linux-0.14-res.yml \r\n\r\n226859486a1c521d9f2a3361da5c6efe3223be162406d774edcefeeb8474f7af  qtum-0.14.9-win-unsigned.tar.gz\r\n03d2d9ebdad88c0523d751be0cd71b040ef8e4d1af88dfb7dd6bf84f3860b76c  qtum-0.14.9-win32-debug.zip\r\n7a4033e3f153c559b677ff7908e1b882b289fa4e8e36a17845bc9eab3f176cd0  qtum-0.14.9-win32-setup-unsigned.exe\r\n37eded1f20a41e20767d0dfdd24a7f1b57fa21de8be4ea047130ff7e5ef7b695  qtum-0.14.9-win32.zip\r\nbf4d24f8b010b4bb229c71805621435e8feabb7d0e385f9184657bb595438d94  qtum-0.14.9-win64-debug.zip\r\nb7ba60cdfd1094656aee15ec34c489f3b2f73a95bb4ea82e7b6f303917d305a9  qtum-0.14.9-win64-setup-unsigned.exe\r\nf93823de377b33d820d1039ce6087e5882ed09919d010120d16ccd2ed4ed604a  qtum-0.14.9-win64.zip\r\nc019236d7d46fab2035cc37550b8cb5978b45ca96e46fae81de9e49de56c5a38  src/qtum-0.14.9.tar.gz\r\n57a021244316250aa036b40f6915f3c99fa1cd89d8ff417912ff5a91ef0005e7  qtum-win-0.14-res.yml\r\n\r\nIn addition, as of the time of this writing, VirusTotal detects 2 false positives on all 32-bit Windows files, and 2 false positives on all 64-bit Windows files.

                "description": "About Qtum and Mainnet Ignition\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nQtum is a decentralized blockchain project built on Bitcoin's UTXO model, with support for Ethereum Virtual Machine based smart contracts, and secured by a proof of stake consensus model. It achieves this through the revolutionary Account Abstraction Layer which allows the EVM to communicate with Qtum's Bitcoin-like UTXO blockchain. For more general information about Qtum as well as links to join our community, go to https://qtum.org\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Qtum Ignition Main Network. This is the main network where the tokens hold value and should be guarded very carefully. There will be a testnet setup soon for developers, in the meantime you can use `-regtest` mode for testing needs. We will announce details about the token swap from QTUM ERC20 coins to QTUM mainnet tokens soon, watch our [website](https://qtum.org) for details about that.  \r\n\r\nThe major features implemented in Qtum Ignition include:\r\n\r\n1. The Ethereum Virtual Machine, which allows for compatibility with most existing Solidity based smart contracts.\r\n2. The Smart Staking Protocol is complete, which is an optimized Proof of Stake implementation designed for a smart contract platform (however, smart contracts can not participate in staking yet).\r\n3. An early and basic smart contract GUI has been implemented that can be used for creating contracts, sending data and Qtum to them, and checking their status by executing them locally. This functionality is similar to Mist's UI right now, but it is still an early version. We will be working on this more to improve it. \r\n4. Regtest mode, which is ideal for developers who wish to create their own private blockchain. It is tuned specifically to make development easier. It will stake blocks automatically every 30 seconds, and can generate proof-of-work blocks instantly as needed.\r\n5. The Decentralized Governance Protocol is completely implemented and functional, which allows certain network parameters to be modified without a fork.\r\n\r\nFor more technical information for how to start developing with Qtum please read the [Guide](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/blob/master/doc/sparknet-guide.md) and also see this tutorial for deploying a simple [faucet smart contract](http://earlz.net/view/2017/06/30/2144/the-qtum-sparknet-faucet) (it hasn't yet been updated for Mainnet for obvious reasons, but all the instructions are the same and you can try them in regtest mode)\r\n\r\nNote: Qtum Core is considered beta software. We make no warranties or guarantees of its security or stability.\r\n\r\nUpdate History\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n* v1.1.2 - Optional update, but recommended if using QRC tokens\r\n    * Fixed a bug with token transactions where the transaction ID displayed was incorrect in the Qt wallet\r\n    * Allow adding 0 balance addresses as the token receiver in the Qt wallet\r\n* v1.1.1: When sending to contracts, the sender address is now the default change address to reduce confusion; fix -salvagewallet so it works with token transactions\r\n* v1.1.0: Add GUI support Qtum QRC tokens, allowing full management of tokens on the Qtum blockchain from the Qt wallet\r\n    * Sending to a contract no longer requires ABI data, allowing easy participation in simple crowdsale contracts\r\n* v1.0.4: Fix bug where certain circumstances when staking could cause the displayed balance to be inaccurate until completely redownloading the blockchain.\r\n* v1.0.3: Fix staker bug that reported false messages; slightly increases staking performance; optimize staker parameters; fix white send button in GUI\r\n* v1.0.2: Various UI fixes, minor gas overflow consensus fix, per-txout exploit fix, testnet mode setup and functioning\r\n* v1.0.1: Fixed network magic bytes and minimum version to ensure the main network does not conflict with the Skynet network\r\n* v1.0: Initial release\r\n\r\nReindex Required When Upgrading from v1.0.1\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhen you first start the Qtum 1.0.2 GUI wallet after using Qtum v1.0.1 it will prompt you that it must reindex the database. This is normal and is a result of switching our internal database format from per-transaction to per-txout. If you use `qtumd -daemon` it will silently fail to start. You need to use `qtumd -daemon -reindex` in this case. \r\n\r\nQtum Documentation and Usage Resources\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nBasic usage resources:\r\n\r\n* [Official Qtum Usage Guide](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/wiki/Qtum-Wallet-Tutorial)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum staking tutorial](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/qtum-staking-tutorial-using-qtum-qt)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum staking tutorial on Raspberry Pi](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/qtum-staking-tutorial-using-qtumd-on-a-raspberry-pi-3)\r\n* [Unofficial guide for keeping your wallet safe](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/encrypting-backing-up-and-restoring-your-qtum-wallet)\r\n* [Block explorer](https://explorer.qtum.org)\r\n* [Unofficial block explorer](https://qtumexplorer.io/)\r\n\r\nDevelopment resources:\r\n\r\n* [Deploying a custom token to Qtum](https://blog.qtum.org/qtum-custom-token-walkthrough-467d725fa27d)\r\n* [Early example faucet contract](http://earlz.net/view/2017/06/30/2144/the-qtum-sparknet-faucet)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum Hello World tutorial](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/quantum-qtum-blockchain-developer-tutorial-hello-world)\r\n\r\nGeneral Info about Qtum:\r\n\r\n* [Mainnet event AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/comments/6zs8t0/official_qtum_ama_thread_starts_at_10pm_beijing/)\r\n* [Qtum's PoS vs CASPER](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/comments/788oa5/qtums_pos_vs_casper_and_the_nothingatstake_problem/)\r\n* [Technical article explaining Qtum's PoS model in depth](http://earlz.net/view/2017/07/27/1904/the-missing-explanation-of-proof-of-stake-version)\r\n* [Unofficial What is Qtum article](https://storeofvalue.github.io/posts/what-is-qtum-without-the-bullshit/)\r\n\r\nQuickstart\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get started with Qtum is to simply download the binaries below. To give a brief breakdown of the different versions available: \r\n\r\n#### Windows\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.8-win64.zip](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.2/qtum-0.14.8-win64.zip) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using Windows.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.8-win64-setup-unsigned.exe](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.2/qtum-0.14.8-win64-setup-unsigned.exe) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using Windows. This includes an installer and will install Qtum system wide.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.8-win32.zip](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.2/qtum-0.14.8-win32.zip) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 machines using Windows. If you have an older Windows computer and don't care about installing Qtum system-wide, \r\n* [qtum-0.14.8-win32-setup-unsigned.exe](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.2/qtum-0.14.8-win32-setup-unsigned.exe) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 machines using Windows. This includes an installer and will install Qtum system wide. If you have an older Windows computer and want to install Qtum then this is for you.\r\n\r\n#### OSX\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.8-osx64.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.2/qtum-0.14.8-osx64.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using OSX. If you use a modern Mac and want development tools, this is what you want; we do not support older 32bit or PowerPC based Macs.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.8-osx-unsigned.dmg](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.2/qtum-0.14.8-osx-unsigned.dmg) - A version of Qtum-Qt built for 64bit x86 machines using OSX in a .DMG installable format. If you use a modern Mac and aren't a developer, this is what you want; we do not support older 32bit or PowerPC based Macs.\r\n\r\n#### Linux\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.8-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.2/qtum-0.14.8-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 PC platforms running Linux. This is probably what you want for older computers running Linux\r\n* [qtum-0.14.8-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.2/qtum-0.14.8-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 PC platforms running Linux. This is probably what you want for any modern PC or server running Linux\r\n* [qtum-0.14.8-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.2/qtum-0.14.8-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz) - A version of qtumd and qtum-cli built for 32bit ARM platforms using Linux. This includes the Raspberry Pi and many of it's clones\r\n* [qtum-0.14.8-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.2/qtum-0.14.8-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of qtumd and qtum-cli built for 64bit ARM platforms using Linux\r\n\r\nBelow in the full list of binaries, there are also versions that include debug symbols. These are useful for developers, but will run slower and are significantly larger to download. \r\n\r\n#### Build Qtum Core\r\n\r\nIf you want to build it from source, it's recommended to follow the specific [\"build\" documentation](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/tree/testnet-2/doc) for your platform. But mostly it boils down to the following:\r\n\r\n1. Clone the qtum source code and cd into `qtum`\r\n\r\n        git clone --recursive https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum.git\r\n        cd qtum\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Build qtum-core:\r\n\r\n    Configure and build the headless qtum binaries as well as the GUI (if Qt is found).\r\n\r\n    You can disable the GUI build by passing `--without-gui` to configure.\r\n\r\n        ./autogen.sh\r\n        ./configure\r\n        make\r\n\r\n3.  It is recommended to build and run the unit tests to ensure everything is working correctly:\r\n\r\n        make check\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you encounter an error like:\r\n\r\n> make[2]: *** No rule to make target \u2018cpp-ethereum/utils/libscrypt/b64.c\u2019, needed by \u2018cpp-ethereum/utils/libscrypt/libbitcoinconsensus_la-b64.lo\u2019.  Stop.\r\n\r\nThen you did not checkout the cpp-ethereum submodule for Qtum. To do that, simply:\r\n\r\n    cd qtum\r\n    git submodule update --init --recursive\r\n\r\nValidate and Reproduce Binaries\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nQtum uses a tool called Gitian to make reproducible builds that can be verified by anyone. Instructions on setting up a Gitian VM and building Qtum are provided [in doc/gitian-building.md](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/blob/master/doc/gitian-building.md)\r\n\r\nCommunity Resources\r\n---------\r\n\r\nMake sure to check out these resources as well for more information and to keep up to date with all the latest news about Qtum. At least 1 developer is always around, so if you're developing on Qtum and need help, we'd love to welcome you to our community.  \r\n\r\n* [/r/Qtum on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/)\r\n* [Qtum Telegram Group](https://t.me/joinchat/D5oBaw29NeOdpw6qqqf2lw)\r\n* [@QtumOfficial on Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/qtumofficial)\r\n* [Qtum on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/QtumOfficial/)\r\n* [Qtum Forum](https://forum.qtum.org/)\r\n* [Qtum.org](https://qtum.org/en/)\r\n\r\n\r\nQtum Smart Contract Limitations\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n* EVM smart contracts can not receive coins from or send coins to any address type other than pay-to-pubkeyhash (starts with Q) addresses. This is due to a limitation in the EVM\r\n* Contracts are not allowed to create contracts with an initial endowment of coins. The contract must first be created, and then be sent coins in a separate transaction. Humans are also not allowed to create contracts with an initial endowment of coins.\r\n* Although all of the infrastructure is present, Qtum Core does not currently parse Solidity event data. You must parse this yourself using either `searchlogs` or `-record-log-opcodes` features.\r\n* It is not possible to send a contract coins without also executing the contract. This is also the case of Ethereum. This was promised in earlier discussions and technically does work, but due to lack of time for testing this feature was disabled. We hope to reenable this feature with release of the x86 virtual machine in 2018.\r\n* In Qtum there can be multiple addresses used to create a proof-of-stake block. However, the EVM can only see the first output using the `coinbase` operation in Solidity (this address is also the one registered for the continuous staker rewards after 500 blocks). \r\n\r\nHash Validation\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\r\nHash: SHA512\r\n\r\nIf you would like to validate that the binaries you download are exactly the same as those provided and built by the Qtum team, then you can compare your binaries to the following sha256sum hashes:\r\n\r\n8b3154f78567b0656e65a27035a97d97a800744dacefae0c6cc286c6866e34a4  qtum-0.14.8-osx-unsigned.dmg\r\nc855987b4bb16a333622a1f5b185573c780512789997f9c628a8c06bfae26eb1  qtum-0.14.8-osx-unsigned.tar.gz\r\n10f4c5574ca900e2134dca9ac8880d5ae0f82ec08c4f9aea88da3937c7a08edb  qtum-0.14.8-osx64.tar.gz\r\nedfd26416545caea73c73c62e6326690fa5a239fcbe66300bd42cdf010dd0cb8  src/qtum-0.14.8.tar.gz\r\n1887a60f01571c1156028dd9b7c3316c387517d7177bdb2d870c0458ac28781d  qtum-osx-0.14-res.yml\r\n\r\n1683f03a3448862cae1bcb0069e06b3b7c9805c90e7d43f64b28b78f2d243cb1  qtum-0.14.8-aarch64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz \r\n3ea7fd8a049ac5e6fb86e75944ccd5bf0dec62ae7cbc0caaa92d6e28b7233d5f  qtum-0.14.8-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz \r\n5ef4a469aedd210cdf855155e6f389aacd890ee2cd9309682f01f9a6e60c62c2  qtum-0.14.8-arm-linux-gnueabihf-debug.tar.gz \r\nfe60a3c82116c98fa25bb6dc203ff6211c26bb4977fa4d3df5290a42b9ecc446  qtum-0.14.8-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz \r\n49b7c64c7b3efa598980feb5442823871208de41a57caf4b124639d4962e4270  qtum-0.14.8-i686-pc-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz \r\n86151f07bebcc044780a1b8f7035d4fe344d4f330040b9b6f55bee5f95434974  qtum-0.14.8-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz \r\nf0ec5d129183bb94d4a06b411b648d0948e55eb1b4c1b117afcde4fd75d2aaed  qtum-0.14.8-x86_64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz \r\na94a5e61473eb83a90e34bae29b1d44af8ed966cac09003148778aa63a46e081  qtum-0.14.8-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz \r\nedfd26416545caea73c73c62e6326690fa5a239fcbe66300bd42cdf010dd0cb8  src/qtum-0.14.8.tar.gz \r\ne940134ac98546638fac8f6a3dc5b006ef1a9ed8f1255e1457f4ffd0e6e10de3  qtum-linux-0.14-res.yml \r\n\r\n274c4653cacf2c9519d0fed6e60e121649ad9311570c4300349c1639926f2433  qtum-0.14.8-win-unsigned.tar.gz\r\n9f910b6f6116eba4530ff86461d9b692725bddce19d3732632d1e25a55e07d29  qtum-0.14.8-win32-debug.zip\r\n2c79d901f503ed110ce46453e1ca06db2a62d266fcbf847e33b102dacfeaa6c5  qtum-0.14.8-win32-setup-unsigned.exe\r\n93ffe9cce42ba2aa104249f5b20de17e9fa95c36f68b8909aefb071151f9be46  qtum-0.14.8-win32.zip\r\n9ba4aad9dfd38db2a853b1f30b683db8b701b665b3d3776e9a377483dad29919  qtum-0.14.8-win64-debug.zip\r\n8f3b4c4e138b81b7bc91cf213dd29a311cc3ca5999b5b80b95a0373b8746ce90  qtum-0.14.8-win64-setup-unsigned.exe\r\n61ea512e630bc9a8783488188460ab176d5ec967d8def2438b9ecc3dccf58d13  qtum-0.14.8-win64.zip\r\na7d1d7a038b3b85f48de56c4f283bf0eb0ee621c6d5d53f3584c0f7398e32fcd  src/qtum-0.14.8.tar.gz\r\nce46c4471d174d7983dcff15d2a289ca6111bc6709d8cd16f0e700ad110ff5dc  qtum-win-0.14-res.yml\r\n\r\nIn addition, as of the time of this writing, VirusTotal detects 2 false positives on all of the windows files.

                "description": "About Qtum and Mainnet Ignition\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nQtum is a decentralized blockchain project built on Bitcoin's UTXO model, with support for Ethereum Virtual Machine based smart contracts, and secured by a proof of stake consensus model. It achieves this through the revolutionary Account Abstraction Layer which allows the EVM to communicate with Qtum's Bitcoin-like UTXO blockchain. For more general information about Qtum as well as links to join our community, go to https://qtum.org\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Qtum Ignition Main Network. This is the main network where the tokens hold value and should be guarded very carefully. There will be a testnet setup soon for developers, in the meantime you can use `-regtest` mode for testing needs. We will announce details about the token swap from QTUM ERC20 coins to QTUM mainnet tokens soon, watch our [website](https://qtum.org) for details about that.  \r\n\r\nThe major features implemented in Qtum Ignition include:\r\n\r\n1. The Ethereum Virtual Machine, which allows for compatibility with most existing Solidity based smart contracts.\r\n2. The Smart Staking Protocol is complete, which is an optimized Proof of Stake implementation designed for a smart contract platform (however, smart contracts can not participate in staking yet).\r\n3. An early and basic smart contract GUI has been implemented that can be used for creating contracts, sending data and Qtum to them, and checking their status by executing them locally. This functionality is similar to Mist's UI right now, but it is still an early version. We will be working on this more to improve it. \r\n4. Regtest mode, which is ideal for developers who wish to create their own private blockchain. It is tuned specifically to make development easier. It will stake blocks automatically every 30 seconds, and can generate proof-of-work blocks instantly as needed.\r\n5. The Decentralized Governance Protocol is completely implemented and functional, which allows certain network parameters to be modified without a fork.\r\n\r\nFor more technical information for how to start developing with Qtum please read the [Guide](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/blob/master/doc/sparknet-guide.md) and also see this tutorial for deploying a simple [faucet smart contract](http://earlz.net/view/2017/06/30/2144/the-qtum-sparknet-faucet) (it hasn't yet been updated for Mainnet for obvious reasons, but all the instructions are the same and you can try them in regtest mode)\r\n\r\nNote: Qtum Core is considered beta software. We make no warranties or guarantees of its security or stability.\r\n\r\nUpdate History\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n* v1.1.1: When sending to contracts, the sender address is now the default change address to reduce confusion; fix -salvagewallet so it works with token transactions\r\n* v1.1.0: Add GUI support Qtum QRC tokens, allowing full management of tokens on the Qtum blockchain from the Qt wallet\r\n    * Sending to a contract no longer requires ABI data, allowing easy participation in simple crowdsale contracts\r\n* v1.0.4: Fix bug where certain circumstances when staking could cause the displayed balance to be inaccurate until completely redownloading the blockchain.\r\n* v1.0.3: Fix staker bug that reported false messages; slightly increases staking performance; optimize staker parameters; fix white send button in GUI\r\n* v1.0.2: Various UI fixes, minor gas overflow consensus fix, per-txout exploit fix, testnet mode setup and functioning\r\n* v1.0.1: Fixed network magic bytes and minimum version to ensure the main network does not conflict with the Skynet network\r\n* v1.0: Initial release\r\n\r\nReindex Required When Upgrading from v1.0.1\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhen you first start the Qtum 1.0.2 GUI wallet after using Qtum v1.0.1 it will prompt you that it must reindex the database. This is normal and is a result of switching our internal database format from per-transaction to per-txout. If you use `qtumd -daemon` it will silently fail to start. You need to use `qtumd -daemon -reindex` in this case. \r\n\r\nQtum Documentation and Usage Resources\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nBasic usage resources:\r\n\r\n* [Official Qtum Usage Guide](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/wiki/Qtum-Wallet-Tutorial)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum staking tutorial](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/qtum-staking-tutorial-using-qtum-qt)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum staking tutorial on Raspberry Pi](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/qtum-staking-tutorial-using-qtumd-on-a-raspberry-pi-3)\r\n* [Unofficial guide for keeping your wallet safe](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/encrypting-backing-up-and-restoring-your-qtum-wallet)\r\n* [Block explorer](https://explorer.qtum.org)\r\n* [Unofficial block explorer](https://qtumexplorer.io/)\r\n\r\nDevelopment resources:\r\n\r\n* [Deploying a custom token to Qtum](https://blog.qtum.org/qtum-custom-token-walkthrough-467d725fa27d)\r\n* [Early example faucet contract](http://earlz.net/view/2017/06/30/2144/the-qtum-sparknet-faucet)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum Hello World tutorial](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/quantum-qtum-blockchain-developer-tutorial-hello-world)\r\n\r\nGeneral Info about Qtum:\r\n\r\n* [Mainnet event AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/comments/6zs8t0/official_qtum_ama_thread_starts_at_10pm_beijing/)\r\n* [Qtum's PoS vs CASPER](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/comments/788oa5/qtums_pos_vs_casper_and_the_nothingatstake_problem/)\r\n* [Technical article explaining Qtum's PoS model in depth](http://earlz.net/view/2017/07/27/1904/the-missing-explanation-of-proof-of-stake-version)\r\n* [Unofficial What is Qtum article](https://storeofvalue.github.io/posts/what-is-qtum-without-the-bullshit/)\r\n\r\nQuickstart\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get started with Qtum is to simply download the binaries below. To give a brief breakdown of the different versions available: \r\n\r\n#### Windows\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.7-win64.zip](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.1/qtum-0.14.7-win64.zip) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using Windows.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.7-win64-setup-unsigned.exe](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.1/qtum-0.14.7-win64-setup-unsigned.exe) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using Windows.

If you have an older Windows computer and don't care about installing Qtum system-wide, \r\n* [qtum-0.14.7-win32-setup-unsigned.exe](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.1/qtum-0.14.7-win32-setup-unsigned.exe) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 machines using Windows. This includes an installer and will install Qtum system wide. If you have an older Windows computer and want to install Qtum then this is for you.\r\n\r\n#### OSX\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.7-osx64.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.1/qtum-0.14.7-osx64.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using OSX. If you use a modern Mac and want development tools, this is what you want; we do not support older 32bit or PowerPC based Macs.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.7-osx-unsigned.dmg](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.1/qtum-0.14.7-osx-unsigned.dmg) - A version of Qtum-Qt built for 64bit x86 machines using OSX in a .DMG installable format. If you use a modern Mac and aren't a developer, this is what you want; we do not support older 32bit or PowerPC based Macs.\r\n\r\n#### Linux\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.7-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.1/qtum-0.14.7-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 PC platforms running Linux. This is probably what you want for older computers running Linux\r\n* [qtum-0.14.7-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.1/qtum-0.14.7-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 PC platforms running Linux. This is probably what you want for any modern PC or server running Linux\r\n* [qtum-0.14.7-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.1/qtum-0.14.7-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz) - A version of qtumd and qtum-cli built for 32bit ARM platforms using Linux. This includes the Raspberry Pi and many of it's clones\r\n* [qtum-0.14.7-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.1/qtum-0.14.7-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of qtumd and qtum-cli built for 64bit ARM platforms using Linux\r\n\r\nBelow in the full list of binaries, there are also versions that include debug symbols. These are useful for developers, but will run slower and are significantly larger to download. \r\n\r\n#### Build Qtum Core\r\n\r\nIf you want to build it from source, it's recommended to follow the specific [\"build\" documentation](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/tree/testnet-2/doc) for your platform. But mostly it boils down to the following:\r\n\r\n1. Clone the qtum source code and cd into `qtum`\r\n\r\n        git clone --recursive https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum.git\r\n        cd qtum\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Build qtum-core:\r\n\r\n    Configure and build the headless qtum binaries as well as the GUI (if Qt is found).\r\n\r\n    You can disable the GUI build by passing `--without-gui` to configure.\r\n\r\n        ./autogen.sh\r\n        ./configure\r\n        make\r\n\r\n3.  It is recommended to build and run the unit tests to ensure everything is working correctly:\r\n\r\n        make check\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you encounter an error like:\r\n\r\n> make[2]: *** No rule to make target \u2018cpp-ethereum/utils/libscrypt/b64.c\u2019, needed by \u2018cpp-ethereum/utils/libscrypt/libbitcoinconsensus_la-b64.lo\u2019.  Stop.\r\n\r\nThen you did not checkout the cpp-ethereum submodule for Qtum. To do that, simply:\r\n\r\n    cd qtum\r\n    git submodule update --init --recursive\r\n\r\nValidate and Reproduce Binaries\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nQtum uses a tool called Gitian to make reproducible builds that can be verified by anyone. Instructions on setting up a Gitian VM and building Qtum are provided [in doc/gitian-building.md](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/blob/master/doc/gitian-building.md)\r\n\r\nCommunity Resources\r\n---------\r\n\r\nMake sure to check out these resources as well for more information and to keep up to date with all the latest news about Qtum. At least 1 developer is always around, so if you're developing on Qtum and need help, we'd love to welcome you to our community.  \r\n\r\n* [/r/Qtum on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/)\r\n* [Qtum Telegram Group](https://t.me/joinchat/D5oBaw29NeOdpw6qqqf2lw)\r\n* [@QtumOfficial on Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/qtumofficial)\r\n* [Qtum on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/QtumOfficial/)\r\n* [Qtum Forum](https://forum.qtum.org/)\r\n* [Qtum.org](https://qtum.org/en/)\r\n\r\n\r\nQtum Smart Contract Limitations\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n* EVM smart contracts can not receive coins from or send coins to any address type other than pay-to-pubkeyhash (starts with Q) addresses. This is due to a limitation in the EVM\r\n* Contracts are not allowed to create contracts with an initial endowment of coins. The contract must first be created, and then be sent coins in a separate transaction. Humans are also not allowed to create contracts with an initial endowment of coins.\r\n* Although all of the infrastructure is present, Qtum Core does not currently parse Solidity event data. You must parse this yourself using either `searchlogs` or `-record-log-opcodes` features.\r\n* It is not possible to send a contract coins without also executing the contract. This is also the case of Ethereum. This was promised in earlier discussions and technically does work, but due to lack of time for testing this feature was disabled. We hope to reenable this feature with release of the x86 virtual machine in 2018.\r\n* In Qtum there can be multiple addresses used to create a proof-of-stake block. However, the EVM can only see the first output using the `coinbase` operation in Solidity (this address is also the one registered for the continuous staker rewards after 500 blocks). \r\n\r\nHash Validation\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\r\nHash: SHA512\r\n\r\nIf you would like to validate that the binaries you download are exactly the same as those provided and built by the Qtum team, then you can compare your binaries to the following sha256sum hashes:\r\n\r\nb852c05722d2f2dc9139ab29c976487c5dc20047c72eb86173bae4680a5aff3b  qtum-0.14.7-osx-unsigned.dmg \r\n4e5a3b3da068835375370522b9fe0cd25cab87af56adbf924714403f92c85150  qtum-0.14.7-osx-unsigned.tar.gz \r\n54f28d3cf61d4f764e68ad4bb64fe03b9c757975cfa085c23e71414d4cd1301a  qtum-0.14.7-osx64.tar.gz \r\na23747d3b59170e0a040a995108b1e4a0a947b06335903a199e4021aada6bc3d  src/qtum-0.14.7.tar.gz \r\necc13ada7fcccf470246e1d9488eeefeb1ceae0431c853cbf8e06a3b60430df6  qtum-osx-0.14-res.yml \r\n\r\n3929ae8b22e32b2f2d6d99e4ec6c654486ac3bc4c663b8054e5243923f504803  qtum-0.14.7-aarch64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\n9b29a0da81b7f3005240a83da9874d10002ed48ec759d57db97e9bc12a9c4eda  qtum-0.14.7-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\ncbee2a21780f33624650e538c4f812d852283c86486f915e285d7455f53ba21a  qtum-0.14.7-arm-linux-gnueabihf-debug.tar.gz\r\n22b885543d4231ca7f6d9c4c023fa2ecb9a44fb630c6cc05a395b21f0fc47f09  qtum-0.14.7-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz\r\n2d58cc607339e19f805529860f927173ed5f9d503a4985fdeaf082ae0d4b44d0  qtum-0.14.7-i686-pc-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\n283753c6f2c8e9848947e8211dffcb08ba9380ce3ab74728858d64239d48ecfb  qtum-0.14.7-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\nb465060bf0e714e4fca305529dc911eca518eb482f53dd652e51af6d5f48fa37  qtum-0.14.7-x86_64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\nf6c49a692734bf021b6c0a53ee32f745b71b7179466eaea98aa398db160a7797  qtum-0.14.7-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\na23747d3b59170e0a040a995108b1e4a0a947b06335903a199e4021aada6bc3d  src/qtum-0.14.7.tar.gz\r\nca422302c4e6d4ab5422acdd138d1eda368e68a229800688d2ed4c4b8c7c3435  qtum-linux-0.14-res.yml\r\n\r\naa7baae9a0710d884da0cae199eb1218644b68b51012d99749385a1436b08213  qtum-0.14.7-win-unsigned.tar.gz\r\n850fc62b59d718691ca35501ded4fcf18c7c54fc863962cc68a8e7b735878f00  qtum-0.14.7-win32-debug.zip\r\n8bc1c9b78063e618d2468623c831d8830238df772169f516a9e56808f2e42ef2  qtum-0.14.7-win32-setup-unsigned.exe\r\n2843fe492f2281076338071ff4f04e9c633b17d9db1e56cf67e45de193044285  qtum-0.14.7-win32.zip\r\n3cb46f26119e85915b681ad8bd99b3b4547cbf590e0d677742d34c31a214a8c9  qtum-0.14.7-win64-debug.zip\r\na642721f52abae5d95a4e644368a851f5e69454e0103d9593eabea75c27f6831  qtum-0.14.7-win64-setup-unsigned.exe\r\nac60106d970b8ff54bdaf592f2725c2fcdeb4967550643ea937dc3233af9087d  qtum-0.14.7-win64.zip\r\ned0e3c8506e9d80dcb443fa160c6bced2b7706c1f7cdd212f836301acf3ba3ff  src/qtum-0.14.7.tar.gz\r\n10b5822b7e3ad878dc14e3cc2156daf63f8e8606e5570e4e73ca768214745612  qtum-win-0.14-res.yml\r\n\r\nIn addition, as of the time of this writing, VirusTotal detects 0 false positives on the Windows 32bit and 64bit zip files and win64 installer, and 1 false positive from 2 vendors on the Windows 32bit installer.\r\n\r\ninstaller win32: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/8bc1c9b78063e618d2468623c831d8830238df772169f516a9e56808f2e42ef2/detection 1 false positive (\"HEUR:Trojan.Win32.Generic\" from Kaspersky and ZoneAlarm)\r\n\r\ninstaller win64 https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/a642721f52abae5d95a4e644368a851f5e69454e0103d9593eabea75c27f6831/detection 0 false positives\r\n\r\nzip win32 https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/2843fe492f2281076338071ff4f04e9c633b17d9db1e56cf67e45de193044285/detection 0 false positives\r\n\r\nzip win64 https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/ac60106d970b8ff54bdaf592f2725c2fcdeb4967550643ea937dc3233af9087d/detection 0 false positives\r\n\r\nYou can validate this message is from Earlz at https://keybase.io/verify\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: Keybase OpenPGP v2.0.76\r\nComment: https://keybase.io/crypto\r\n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\r\nScxZUHP9h/9LgLj/tLSe\r\n=PmzK\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n```",

                "description": "About Qtum and Mainnet Ignition\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nQtum is a decentralized blockchain project built on Bitcoin's UTXO model, with support for Ethereum Virtual Machine based smart contracts, and secured by a proof of stake consensus model. It achieves this through the revolutionary Account Abstraction Layer which allows the EVM to communicate with Qtum's Bitcoin-like UTXO blockchain. For more general information about Qtum as well as links to join our community, go to https://qtum.org\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Qtum Ignition Main Network. This is the main network where the tokens hold value and should be guarded very carefully. There will be a testnet setup soon for developers, in the meantime you can use `-regtest` mode for testing needs. We will announce details about the token swap from QTUM ERC20 coins to QTUM mainnet tokens soon, watch our [website](https://qtum.org) for details about that.  \r\n\r\nThe major features implemented in Qtum Ignition include:\r\n\r\n1. The Ethereum Virtual Machine, which allows for compatibility with most existing Solidity based smart contracts.\r\n2. The Smart Staking Protocol is complete, which is an optimized Proof of Stake implementation designed for a smart contract platform (however, smart contracts can not participate in staking yet).\r\n3. An early and basic smart contract GUI has been implemented that can be used for creating contracts, sending data and Qtum to them, and checking their status by executing them locally. This functionality is similar to Mist's UI right now, but it is still an early version. We will be working on this more to improve it. \r\n4. Regtest mode, which is ideal for developers who wish to create their own private blockchain. It is tuned specifically to make development easier. It will stake blocks automatically every 30 seconds, and can generate proof-of-work blocks instantly as needed.\r\n5. The Decentralized Governance Protocol is completely implemented and functional, which allows certain network parameters to be modified without a fork.\r\n\r\nFor more technical information for how to start developing with Qtum please read the [Guide](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/blob/master/doc/sparknet-guide.md) and also see this tutorial for deploying a simple [faucet smart contract](http://earlz.net/view/2017/06/30/2144/the-qtum-sparknet-faucet) (it hasn't yet been updated for Mainnet for obvious reasons, but all the instructions are the same and you can try them in regtest mode)\r\n\r\nNote: Qtum Core is considered beta software. We make no warranties or guarantees of its security or stability.\r\n\r\nUpdate History\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n* v1.1.0: Add GUI support Qtum QRC tokens, allowing full management of tokens on the Qtum blockchain from the Qt wallet\r\n    * Sending to a contract no longer requires ABI data, allowing easy participation in simple crowdsale contracts\r\n* v1.0.4: Fix bug where certain circumstances when staking could cause the displayed balance to be inaccurate until completely redownloading the blockchain.\r\n* v1.0.3: Fix staker bug that reported false messages; slightly increases staking performance; optimize staker parameters; fix white send button in GUI\r\n* v1.0.2: Various UI fixes, minor gas overflow consensus fix, per-txout exploit fix, testnet mode setup and functioning\r\n* v1.0.1: Fixed network magic bytes and minimum version to ensure the main network does not conflict with the Skynet network\r\n* v1.0: Initial release\r\n\r\nReindex Required When Upgrading from v1.0.1\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhen you first start the Qtum 1.0.2 GUI wallet after using Qtum v1.0.1 it will prompt you that it must reindex the database. This is normal and is a result of switching our internal database format from per-transaction to per-txout. If you use `qtumd -daemon` it will silently fail to start. You need to use `qtumd -daemon -reindex` in this case. \r\n\r\nQtum Documentation and Usage Resources\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nBasic usage resources:\r\n\r\n* [Official Qtum Usage Guide](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/wiki/Qtum-Wallet-Tutorial)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum staking tutorial](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/qtum-staking-tutorial-using-qtum-qt)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum staking tutorial on Raspberry Pi](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/qtum-staking-tutorial-using-qtumd-on-a-raspberry-pi-3)\r\n* [Unofficial guide for keeping your wallet safe](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/encrypting-backing-up-and-restoring-your-qtum-wallet)\r\n* [Block explorer](https://explorer.qtum.org)\r\n* [Unofficial block explorer](https://qtumexplorer.io/)\r\n\r\nDevelopment resources:\r\n\r\n* [Deploying a custom token to Qtum](https://blog.qtum.org/qtum-custom-token-walkthrough-467d725fa27d)\r\n* [Early example faucet contract](http://earlz.net/view/2017/06/30/2144/the-qtum-sparknet-faucet)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum Hello World tutorial](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/quantum-qtum-blockchain-developer-tutorial-hello-world)\r\n\r\nGeneral Info about Qtum:\r\n\r\n* [Mainnet event AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/comments/6zs8t0/official_qtum_ama_thread_starts_at_10pm_beijing/)\r\n* [Qtum's PoS vs CASPER](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/comments/788oa5/qtums_pos_vs_casper_and_the_nothingatstake_problem/)\r\n* [Technical article explaining Qtum's PoS model in depth](http://earlz.net/view/2017/07/27/1904/the-missing-explanation-of-proof-of-stake-version)\r\n* [Unofficial What is Qtum article](https://storeofvalue.github.io/posts/what-is-qtum-without-the-bullshit/)\r\n\r\nQuickstart\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get started with Qtum is to simply download the binaries below. To give a brief breakdown of the different versions available: \r\n\r\n#### Windows\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.6-win64.zip](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.0/qtum-0.14.6-win64.zip) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using Windows.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.6-win64-setup-unsigned.exe](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.0/qtum-0.14.6-win64-setup-unsigned.exe) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using Windows. This includes an installer and will install Qtum system wide.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.6-win32.zip](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.0/qtum-0.14.6-win32.zip) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 machines using Windows. If you have an older Windows computer and don't care about installing Qtum system-wide, \r\n* [qtum-0.14.6-win32-setup-unsigned.exe](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.0/qtum-0.14.6-win32-setup-unsigned.exe) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 machines using Windows. This includes an installer and will install Qtum system wide. If you have an older Windows computer and want to install Qtum then this is for you.\r\n\r\n#### OSX\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.6-osx64.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.0/qtum-0.14.6-osx64.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using OSX. If you use a modern Mac and want development tools, this is what you want; we do not support older 32bit or PowerPC based Macs.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.6-osx-unsigned.dmg](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.0/qtum-0.14.6-osx-unsigned.dmg) - A version of Qtum-Qt built for 64bit x86 machines using OSX in a .DMG installable format. If you use a modern Mac and aren't a developer, this is what you want; we do not support older 32bit or PowerPC based Macs.\r\n\r\n#### Linux\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.6-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.0/qtum-0.14.6-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 PC platforms running Linux. This is probably what you want for older computers running Linux\r\n* [qtum-0.14.6-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.0/qtum-0.14.6-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 PC platforms running Linux. This is probably what you want for any modern PC or server running Linux\r\n* [qtum-0.14.6-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.0/qtum-0.14.6-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz) - A version of qtumd and qtum-cli built for 32bit ARM platforms using Linux. This includes the Raspberry Pi and many of it's clones\r\n* [qtum-0.14.6-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.1.0/qtum-0.14.6-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of qtumd and qtum-cli built for 64bit ARM platforms using Linux\r\n\r\nBelow in the full list of binaries, there are also versions that include debug symbols. These are useful for developers, but will run slower and are significantly larger to download. \r\n\r\n#### Build Qtum Core\r\n\r\nIf you want to build it from source, it's recommended to follow the specific [\"build\" documentation](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/tree/testnet-2/doc) for your platform. But mostly it boils down to the following:\r\n\r\n1. Clone the qtum source code and cd into `qtum`\r\n\r\n        git clone --recursive https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum.git\r\n        cd qtum\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Build qtum-core:\r\n\r\n    Configure and build the headless qtum binaries as well as the GUI (if Qt is found).\r\n\r\n    You can disable the GUI build by passing `--without-gui` to configure.\r\n\r\n        ./autogen.sh\r\n        ./configure\r\n        make\r\n\r\n3.  It is recommended to build and run the unit tests to ensure everything is working correctly:\r\n\r\n        make check\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you encounter an error like:\r\n\r\n> make[2]: *** No rule to make target \u2018cpp-ethereum/utils/libscrypt/b64.c\u2019, needed by \u2018cpp-ethereum/utils/libscrypt/libbitcoinconsensus_la-b64.lo\u2019.  Stop.\r\n\r\nThen you did not checkout the cpp-ethereum submodule for Qtum. To do that, simply:\r\n\r\n    cd qtum\r\n    git submodule update --init --recursive\r\n\r\nValidate and Reproduce Binaries\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nQtum uses a tool called Gitian to make reproducible builds that can be verified by anyone. Instructions on setting up a Gitian VM and building Qtum are provided [in doc/gitian-building.md](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/blob/master/doc/gitian-building.md)\r\n\r\nCommunity Resources\r\n---------\r\n\r\nMake sure to check out these resources as well for more information and to keep up to date with all the latest news about Qtum. At least 1 developer is always around, so if you're developing on Qtum and need help, we'd love to welcome you to our community.  \r\n\r\n* [/r/Qtum on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/)\r\n* [Qtum Telegram Group](https://t.me/joinchat/D5oBaw29NeOdpw6qqqf2lw)\r\n* [@QtumOfficial on Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/qtumofficial)\r\n* [Qtum on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/QtumOfficial/)\r\n* [Qtum Forum](https://forum.qtum.org/)\r\n* [Qtum.org](https://qtum.org/en/)\r\n\r\n\r\nQtum Smart Contract Limitations\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n* EVM smart contracts can not receive coins from or send coins to any address type other than pay-to-pubkeyhash (starts with Q) addresses. This is due to a limitation in the EVM\r\n* Contracts are not allowed to create contracts with an initial endowment of coins. The contract must first be created, and then be sent coins in a separate transaction. Humans are also not allowed to create contracts with an initial endowment of coins.\r\n* Although all of the infrastructure is present, Qtum Core does not currently parse Solidity event data. You must parse this yourself using either `searchlogs` or `-record-log-opcodes` features.\r\n* It is not possible to send a contract coins without also executing the contract. This is also the case of Ethereum. This was promised in earlier discussions and technically does work, but due to lack of time for testing this feature was disabled. We hope to reenable this feature with release of the x86 virtual machine in 2018.\r\n* In Qtum there can be multiple addresses used to create a proof-of-stake block. However, the EVM can only see the first output using the `coinbase` operation in Solidity (this address is also the one registered for the continuous staker rewards after 500 blocks). \r\n\r\nHash Validation\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\r\nHash: SHA512\r\n\r\nIf you would like to validate that the binaries you download are exactly the same as those provided and built by the Qtum team, then you can compare your binaries to the following sha256sum hashes:\r\n\r\nf969b3f59a8a62bed2419766580cf0a9849db141e5fb22adc538ba27dc26f2ba  qtum-0.14.6-osx-unsigned.dmg\r\n143cc4dd0dc7c27d37f0577be90244c27d9bc774f1ad2f880cd6b2d2eff48db3  qtum-0.14.6-osx-unsigned.tar.gz\r\n58de033b5f091de665e2d50e1c18adbf2867451c555e187582f36238b4dfcbfa  qtum-0.14.6-osx64.tar.gz\r\n1a4f407ad165177a9950c33053778e44c5b1a1d5d913a8fcd27f7ada698087f8  src/qtum-0.14.6.tar.gz\r\n9aac11978cf3aa1fa814885253fdb0c59b3d050113597786d07446929dc6b01a  qtum-osx-0.14-res.yml\r\n\r\n2a404b42149dc1ef617b1d582e5690cb2d4cb386e4e4e6aa94fc412c8017ef41685  qtum-0.14.6-aarch64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\n8dae9d9a8bc38d18b53bafa1ac4a87c93b3308cea69c10558c04cbfe155249de  qtum-0.14.6-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\n206a6b32953ebafa5cb26c435334fba780222a84860025953cefe623487614b1  qtum-0.14.6-arm-linux-gnueabihf-debug.tar.gz\r\n1063aa207afa9bf61e4633a28d8ec8c3d2f72f8cc43e284f58346a8a96bf9970  qtum-0.14.6-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz\r\nd2eb64462f63bd5e83a822103d0edb6d6be1ed2c1bc91ac26000dfffb42d0a1b  qtum-0.14.6-i686-pc-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\ne1a8790e4810c6a999fa76119b319f4cffaa336f3716477b02b00f77b1182eaf  qtum-0.14.6-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\nb267fe4342610e17351528d1334a427092f1e36479cd68e63d7e76ccc21e7445  qtum-0.14.6-x86_64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\n35122c1a05745aad43b6044c83a9d93c0c0725b2461c40eab5afd5dd598cd4ae  qtum-0.14.6-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\n1a4f407ad165177a9950c33053778e44c5b1a1d5d913a8fcd27f7ada698087f8  src/qtum-0.14.6.tar.gz\r\n89484b7caa427959dfee542358489e7a1c50a840f286102af0a428e3cfd0891f  qtum-linux-0.14-res.yml\r\n\r\na1ebed92a95f69008116e55585deacea18279407bd6612664d1d349c4588a3a3  qtum-0.14.6-win-unsigned.tar.gz\r\n818b32af02061c3c173b538701297018ba90c96a90d207837a7ee2071483ca39  qtum-0.14.6-win32-debug.zip\r\n6c2d3d0bdb947cab3a3a4e360c007c25644ed58806edf42aa334af37431a664b  qtum-0.14.6-win32-setup-unsigned.exe\r\n9b5ab577dd843da6195d0d0d78f4676a468e56d73936c774cdebd970f2d24a23  qtum-0.14.6-win32.zip\r\nce0e1d041a771bfd83a934208ca6fbc28f0cb5cbdc415d0d86d527c794900bb2  qtum-0.14.6-win64-debug.zip\r\n28f5e68958eebb97499b6e150b922ede2cd6a80b4d385eeb19e073a38e066b33  qtum-0.14.6-win64-setup-unsigned.exe\r\n715e65dc007a52d52dc1bb43a723cdd84a225d843c4c2786e8c402fdae3a0440  qtum-0.14.6-win64.zip\r\n44c87b827304adef7febf9feaf39ef897eadaf42dbadf52e22be639dc47799a6  src/qtum-0.14.6.tar.gz\r\nbb8f6868c07e0aab8a6d9fd0f096b4c2a4e13651baf1b958bd9fe8c631ea2574  qtum-win-0.14-res.yml\r\n\r\nIn addition, as of the time of this writing, VirusTotal detects 0 false positives on the Windows 32bit and 64bit zip files, and 1 false positive on the Windows 32bit and 64bit installer:\r\n\r\ninstaller win32: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/6c2d3d0bdb947cab3a3a4e360c007c25644ed58806edf42aa334af37431a664b/detection 1 false positive (\"unsafe\" by Cylance)\r\n\r\ninstaller win64 https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/28f5e68958eebb97499b6e150b922ede2cd6a80b4d385eeb19e073a38e066b33/detection 1 false positive (\"unsafe\" by Cylance)\r\n\r\nzip win32 https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/9b5ab577dd843da6195d0d0d78f4676a468e56d73936c774cdebd970f2d24a23/detection 0 false positives\r\n\r\nzip win64 https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/715e65dc007a52d52dc1bb43a723cdd84a225d843c4c2786e8c402fdae3a0440/detection 0 false positives\r\n\r\nYou can validate this message is from Earlz at https://keybase.io/verify\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: Keybase OpenPGP v2.0.76\r\nComment: https://keybase.io/crypto\r\n\r\nwsFcBAABCgAGBQJZ/N9fAAoJEAKXMK2l7Ra+GIIP/R/wOpXWb9/H2q0XJEgH9hKd\r\nRCtpzzNO+Qfbeg4gGLim2DRtfnlbvUnvXOCJSGMPDmUEc50e5r5saGwWLS0TYzQk\r\nSfyIbgMEHwMTrOI3Ri8V8P+T1vQKoXB1A7hYZJw8RpKg0ymu148SykEye6mlLqXj\r\nlon80axyE+qqphuGuDmnjvXCp1N7PifNCIZBTs5+G20By3j+1lcT6fL7+4aIDws4\r\nP2dhQY3ZY6M4jPe7qp2LDCHZt/5foIcekaIZsg8foXVyVN5nPSq1v+SJLFpDrD18\r\n0eF1xnxUeR1be1KJ7UfVOECHMLrwrWNhVlyYxgh03+qRg5Kx8KUK7yyyM5mg8wsO\r\nSFZDWiA5LjiHDsggq7utOyejWZQDqC22Yv198ALDaG6b4BISw1XMYz+8rg3tOrac\r\ncckMXLLQUdtYRpBPcXK3ItXFIOKbXFoQ+YMrHZrw780NAEEVWj0cKCa2JdCniRIP\r\nuohzRMuG+4wyK6uP+uK7E/BBjWz98mqn75WRuZIkMxIYbyxClz9hwxpLewkCssAt\r\nq5Z2/HP0xJDHDCFOYdsrwJzpN+HbQODqigzlf+Q97ukfJ8ZBcogPtyohh4oDJC2U\r\ndIq5Jj2KuXQpMpi7F1CYG+Oy295p67cjSoDg2w73+QayjDSUdKs0yWiNxjtAYLYr\r\n9iG+3V1xROLj+cm0N9KL\r\n=+svp\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n```\r\n",

                "name": "Mainnet Ignition v1.0.4 - Recommended Staking Update",
                "description": "About Qtum and Mainnet Ignition\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nQtum is a decentralized blockchain project built on Bitcoin's UTXO model, with support for Ethereum Virtual Machine based smart contracts, and secured by a proof of stake consensus model. It achieves this through the revolutionary Account Abstraction Layer which allows the EVM to communicate with Qtum's Bitcoin-like UTXO blockchain. For more general information about Qtum as well as links to join our community, go to https://qtum.org\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Qtum Ignition Main Network. This is the main network where the tokens hold value and should be guarded very carefully. There will be a testnet setup soon for developers, in the meantime you can use `-regtest` mode for testing needs. We will announce details about the token swap from QTUM ERC20 coins to QTUM mainnet tokens soon, watch our [website](https://qtum.org) for details about that.  \r\n\r\nThe major features implemented in Qtum Ignition include:\r\n\r\n1. The Ethereum Virtual Machine, which allows for compatibility with most existing Solidity based smart contracts.\r\n2. The Smart Staking Protocol is complete, which is an optimized Proof of Stake implementation designed for a smart contract platform (however, smart contracts can not participate in staking yet).\r\n3. An early and basic smart contract GUI has been implemented that can be used for creating contracts, sending data and Qtum to them, and checking their status by executing them locally. This functionality is similar to Mist's UI right now, but it is still an early version. We will be working on this more to improve it. \r\n4. Regtest mode, which is ideal for developers who wish to create their own private blockchain. It is tuned specifically to make development easier. It will stake blocks automatically every 30 seconds, and can generate proof-of-work blocks instantly as needed.\r\n5. The Decentralized Governance Protocol is completely implemented and functional, which allows certain network parameters to be modified without a fork.\r\n\r\nFor more technical information for how to start developing with Qtum please read the [Guide](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/blob/master/doc/sparknet-guide.md) and also see this tutorial for deploying a simple [faucet smart contract](http://earlz.net/view/2017/06/30/2144/the-qtum-sparknet-faucet) (it hasn't yet been updated for Mainnet for obvious reasons, but all the instructions are the same and you can try them in regtest mode)\r\n\r\nNote: Qtum Core is considered beta software. We make no warranties or guarantees of its security or stability.\r\n\r\nUpdate History\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n* v1.0.4: Fix bug where certain circumstances when staking could cause the displayed balance to be inaccurate until completely redownloading the blockchain.\r\n* v1.0.3: Fix staker bug that reported false messages; slightly increases staking performance; optimize staker parameters; fix white send button in GUI\r\n* v1.0.2: Various UI fixes, minor gas overflow consensus fix, per-txout exploit fix, testnet mode setup and functioning\r\n* v1.0.1: Fixed network magic bytes and minimum version to ensure the main network does not conflict with the Skynet network\r\n* v1.0: Initial release\r\n\r\nReindex Required When Upgrading from v1.0.1\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhen you first start the Qtum 1.0.2 GUI wallet after using Qtum v1.0.1 it will prompt you that it must reindex the database. This is normal and is a result of switching our internal database format from per-transaction to per-txout. If you use `qtumd -daemon` it will silently fail to start. You need to use `qtumd -daemon -reindex` in this case. \r\n\r\nQtum Documentation and Usage Resources\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nBasic usage resources:\r\n\r\n* [Official Qtum Usage Guide](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/wiki/Qtum-Wallet-Tutorial)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum staking tutorial](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/qtum-staking-tutorial-using-qtum-qt)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum staking tutorial on Raspberry Pi](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/qtum-staking-tutorial-using-qtumd-on-a-raspberry-pi-3)\r\n* [Unofficial guide for keeping your wallet safe](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/encrypting-backing-up-and-restoring-your-qtum-wallet)\r\n* [Block explorer](https://explorer.qtum.org)\r\n* [Unofficial block explorer](https://qtumexplorer.io/)\r\n\r\nDevelopment resources:\r\n\r\n* [Deploying a custom token to Qtum](https://blog.qtum.org/qtum-custom-token-walkthrough-467d725fa27d)\r\n* [Early example faucet contract](http://earlz.net/view/2017/06/30/2144/the-qtum-sparknet-faucet)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum Hello World tutorial](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/quantum-qtum-blockchain-developer-tutorial-hello-world)\r\n\r\nGeneral Info about Qtum:\r\n\r\n* [Mainnet event AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/comments/6zs8t0/official_qtum_ama_thread_starts_at_10pm_beijing/)\r\n* [Qtum's PoS vs CASPER](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/comments/788oa5/qtums_pos_vs_casper_and_the_nothingatstake_problem/)\r\n* [Technical article explaining Qtum's PoS model in depth](http://earlz.net/view/2017/07/27/1904/the-missing-explanation-of-proof-of-stake-version)\r\n* [Unofficial What is Qtum article](https://storeofvalue.github.io/posts/what-is-qtum-without-the-bullshit/)\r\n\r\nQuickstart\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get started with Qtum is to simply download the binaries below. To give a brief breakdown of the different versions available: \r\n\r\n#### Windows\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.5-win64.zip](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.4/qtum-0.14.5-win64.zip) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using Windows.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.5-win64-setup-unsigned.exe](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.4/qtum-0.14.5-win64-setup-unsigned.exe) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using Windows. This includes an installer and will install Qtum system wide.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.5-win32.zip](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.4/qtum-0.14.5-win32.zip) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 machines using Windows. If you have an older Windows computer and don't care about installing Qtum system-wide, \r\n* [qtum-0.14.5-win32-setup-unsigned.exe](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.4/qtum-0.14.5-win32-setup-unsigned.exe) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 machines using Windows. This includes an installer and will install Qtum system wide. If you have an older Windows computer and want to install Qtum then this is for you.\r\n\r\n#### OSX\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.5-osx64.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.4/qtum-0.14.5-osx64.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using OSX. If you use a modern Mac and want development tools, this is what you want; we do not support older 32bit or PowerPC based Macs.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.5-osx-unsigned.dmg](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.4/qtum-0.14.5-osx-unsigned.dmg) - A version of Qtum-Qt built for 64bit x86 machines using OSX in a .DMG installable format. If you use a modern Mac and aren't a developer, this is what you want; we do not support older 32bit or PowerPC based Macs.\r\n\r\n#### Linux\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.5-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.4/qtum-0.14.5-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 PC platforms running Linux. This is probably what you want for older computers running Linux\r\n* [qtum-0.14.5-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.4/qtum-0.14.5-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 PC platforms running Linux. This is probably what you want for any modern PC or server running Linux\r\n* [qtum-0.14.5-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.4/qtum-0.14.5-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz) - A version of qtumd and qtum-cli built for 32bit ARM platforms using Linux. This includes the Raspberry Pi and many of it's clones\r\n* [qtum-0.14.5-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.4/qtum-0.14.5-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of qtumd and qtum-cli built for 64bit ARM platforms using Linux\r\n\r\nBelow in the full list of binaries, there are also versions that include debug symbols. These are useful for developers, but will run slower and are significantly larger to download. \r\n\r\n#### Build Qtum Core\r\n\r\nIf you want to build it from source, it's recommended to follow the specific [\"build\" documentation](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/tree/testnet-2/doc) for your platform. But mostly it boils down to the following:\r\n\r\n1. Clone the qtum source code and cd into `qtum`\r\n\r\n        git clone --recursive https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum.git\r\n        cd qtum\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Build qtum-core:\r\n\r\n    Configure and build the headless qtum binaries as well as the GUI (if Qt is found).\r\n\r\n    You can disable the GUI build by passing `--without-gui` to configure.\r\n\r\n        ./autogen.sh\r\n        ./configure\r\n        make\r\n\r\n3.  It is recommended to build and run the unit tests to ensure everything is working correctly:\r\n\r\n        make check\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you encounter an error like:\r\n\r\n> make[2]: *** No rule to make target \u2018cpp-ethereum/utils/libscrypt/b64.c\u2019, needed by \u2018cpp-ethereum/utils/libscrypt/libbitcoinconsensus_la-b64.lo\u2019.  Stop.\r\n\r\nThen you did not checkout the cpp-ethereum submodule for Qtum. To do that, simply:\r\n\r\n    cd qtum\r\n    git submodule update --init --recursive\r\n\r\nValidate and Reproduce Binaries\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nQtum uses a tool called Gitian to make reproducible builds that can be verified by anyone. Instructions on setting up a Gitian VM and building Qtum are provided [in doc/gitian-building.md](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/blob/master/doc/gitian-building.md)\r\n\r\nCommunity Resources\r\n---------\r\n\r\nMake sure to check out these resources as well for more information and to keep up to date with all the latest news about Qtum. At least 1 developer is always around, so if you're developing on Qtum and need help, we'd love to welcome you to our community.  \r\n\r\n* [/r/Qtum on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/)\r\n* [Qtum Telegram Group](https://t.me/joinchat/D5oBaw29NeOdpw6qqqf2lw)\r\n* [@QtumOfficial on Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/qtumofficial)\r\n* [Qtum on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/QtumOfficial/)\r\n* [Qtum Forum](https://forum.qtum.org/)\r\n* [Qtum.org](https://qtum.org/en/)\r\n\r\n\r\nQtum Smart Contract Limitations\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n* EVM smart contracts can not receive coins from or send coins to any address type other than pay-to-pubkeyhash (starts with Q) addresses. This is due to a limitation in the EVM\r\n* Contracts are not allowed to create contracts with an initial endowment of coins. The contract must first be created, and then be sent coins in a separate transaction. Humans are also not allowed to create contracts with an initial endowment of coins.\r\n* Although all of the infrastructure is present, Qtum Core does not currently parse Solidity event data. You must parse this yourself using either `searchlogs` or `-record-log-opcodes` features.\r\n* It is not possible to send a contract coins without also executing the contract. This is also the case of Ethereum. This was promised in earlier discussions and technically does work, but due to lack of time for testing this feature was disabled. We hope to reenable this feature with release of the x86 virtual machine in 2018.\r\n* In Qtum there can be multiple addresses used to create a proof-of-stake block. However, the EVM can only see the first output using the `coinbase` operation in Solidity (this address is also the one registered for the continuous staker rewards after 500 blocks). \r\n\r\nHash Validation\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\r\nHash: SHA512\r\n\r\nIf you would like to validate that the binaries you download are exactly the same as those provided and built by the Qtum team, then you can compare your binaries to the following sha256sum hashes:\r\n\r\n191cea2e4d1e1e6eda48a2044352497503db864bcb9d37e82f54f0ac0993b5c1  qtum-0.14.5-osx-unsigned.dmg\r\n0a07a7cf7b66dcc214c551825672aaf0055d5047b621c67e8d7113bbeb2a6d49  qtum-0.14.5-osx-unsigned.tar.gz\r\n16865c934a79350f9378baf49fbce5ef482d9f5ea4e90ffdd4f200344032f062  qtum-0.14.5-osx64.tar.gz\r\n3d056fdd4d19ac7e7323f933c98650bc787becd72d4aad8a495e3017cf686589  src/qtum-0.14.5.tar.gz\r\nb8e1d0096b041fdbbda6b086321da1b61289147653ce7d525bfc2c398e33e7f0  qtum-osx-0.14-res.yml\r\n\r\n2a4d502f9b914c021ef83fd10ccfc628369ce4bed3818ae9f078a4192c627380  qtum-0.14.5-aarch64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\nabc7f201f1621cc960a1dd8bb1fb60c7d50ac6a2a8e589c25183c687022d0a90  qtum-0.14.5-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\n50e9c53284ae8a33f35b6db3ef88e91bdb433211a1bee7dffacdf8c68796a8b1  qtum-0.14.5-arm-linux-gnueabihf-debug.tar.gz\r\n113d7b889f6a8112e0a0749c5570ed6f8e0425a71be1c9129f94b46027dd2b4b  qtum-0.14.5-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz\r\ncd03398747c543eb298a342a98f709058f5a819c741fd9f0287f82915f5f97f3  qtum-0.14.5-i686-pc-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\nc944edc6b0ae607ee0c1ae265c3690662c1341d71acd4be339786d0ed033381b  qtum-0.14.5-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\n91e181510e707f214c1a33a5801280b7ff2cfce35e58b5604adad2affceab5f7  qtum-0.14.5-x86_64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\n754dac3e4e719b88851281175e660708f502427a846a33778e3a5331aa06c576  qtum-0.14.5-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\n3d056fdd4d19ac7e7323f933c98650bc787becd72d4aad8a495e3017cf686589  src/qtum-0.14.5.tar.gz\r\nd27216322779b4305f62a9f2d1905c0fef0b8c6d13243e93bf1857116749fa8d  qtum-linux-0.14-res.yml\r\n\r\n69b316b9d069f0374255496fcc28540279fc40725f7bb4211aa6a84682159618  qtum-0.14.5-win-unsigned.tar.gz\r\n23874dfbf194945426529f6e9bd116908e10b345221c5e94693b700c6bc3321e  qtum-0.14.5-win32-debug.zip\r\n856c4a85b53eff7c63787ab0498852e2f16af8088415e93ce5a534f719768fe2  qtum-0.14.5-win32-setup-unsigned.exe\r\n6364f81877b8867d4fbf35cc28067b470ef8abc6d3d63d9eb58283ec3abac317  qtum-0.14.5-win32.zip\r\nb8cc0d50513ebae0e3a591090c9f536c618a6434b5065b7fe5fba8053a2c8ede  qtum-0.14.5-win64-debug.zip\r\n77a555d8d4ccf08b112b8424c562b214fbd94f352454235102ffe672d533aff4  qtum-0.14.5-win64-setup-unsigned.exe\r\n3b89aef0e01af7d30424b3e5db15dde3da3f675eb731cef61304c5f8f5b8e90e  qtum-0.14.5-win64.zip\r\n0f2b3338e9e941f60a02cc923767c36983c37104658327369bc72ae6ab5a18f0  src/qtum-0.14.5.tar.gz\r\n448a1a2ddbee689492dc322ebd4b3bc3c3463ff628f310e9a7e45c00d3ed9cd8  qtum-win-0.14-res.yml\r\n\r\nIn addition, as of the time of this writing, VirusTotal detects 0 false positives on the Windows 32bit and 64bit zip files, 0 false positives on the Windows 32bit installer, and 1 false positive on the Windows 64bit installer:\r\n\r\ninstaller win32: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/856c4a85b53eff7c63787ab0498852e2f16af8088415e93ce5a534f719768fe2/detection 0 false positives.\r\n\r\ninstaller win64 https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/3b89aef0e01af7d30424b3e5db15dde3da3f675eb731cef61304c5f8f5b8e90e/detection 1 false positive(AhnLab-V3 Trojan/MSIl.Disfa.C2221224)\r\n\r\nzip win32 https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/6364f81877b8867d4fbf35cc28067b470ef8abc6d3d63d9eb58283ec3abac317/detection 0 false positives\r\n\r\nzip win64 https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/77a555d8d4ccf08b112b8424c562b214fbd94f352454235102ffe672d533aff4/detection 0 false positives\r\n\r\nYou can validate this message is from Earlz at https://keybase.io/verify\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: Keybase OpenPGP v2.0.76\r\nComment: https://keybase.io/crypto\r\n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\r\nAp3KyxYWxaOGfdxrI5MC\r\n=WDoX\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n\r\n```\r\n",

                "description": "About Qtum and Mainnet Ignition\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nQtum is a decentralized blockchain project built on Bitcoin's UTXO model, with support for Ethereum Virtual Machine based smart contracts, and secured by a proof of stake consensus model. It achieves this through the revolutionary Account Abstraction Layer which allows the EVM to communicate with Qtum's Bitcoin-like UTXO blockchain. For more general information about Qtum as well as links to join our community, go to https://qtum.org\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Qtum Ignition Main Network. This is the main network where the tokens hold value and should be guarded very carefully. There will be a testnet setup soon for developers, in the meantime you can use `-regtest` mode for testing needs. We will announce details about the token swap from QTUM ERC20 coins to QTUM mainnet tokens soon, watch our [website](https://qtum.org) for details about that.  \r\n\r\nThe major features implemented in Qtum Ignition include:\r\n\r\n1. The Ethereum Virtual Machine, which allows for compatibility with most existing Solidity based smart contracts.\r\n2. The Smart Staking Protocol is complete, which is an optimized Proof of Stake implementation designed for a smart contract platform (however, smart contracts can not participate in staking yet).\r\n3. An early and basic smart contract GUI has been implemented that can be used for creating contracts, sending data and Qtum to them, and checking their status by executing them locally. This functionality is similar to Mist's UI right now, but it is still an early version. We will be working on this more to improve it. \r\n4. Regtest mode, which is ideal for developers who wish to create their own private blockchain. It is tuned specifically to make development easier. It will stake blocks automatically every 30 seconds, and can generate proof-of-work blocks instantly as needed.\r\n5. The Decentralized Governance Protocol is completely implemented and functional, which allows certain network parameters to be modified without a fork.\r\n\r\nFor more technical information for how to start developing with Qtum please read the [Guide](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/blob/master/doc/sparknet-guide.md) and also see this tutorial for deploying a simple [faucet smart contract](http://earlz.net/view/2017/06/30/2144/the-qtum-sparknet-faucet) (it hasn't yet been updated for Mainnet for obvious reasons, but all the instructions are the same and you can try them in regtest mode)\r\n\r\nNote: Qtum Core is considered beta software. We make no warranties or guarantees of its security or stability.\r\n\r\nUpdate History\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n* v1.0.3: Fix staker bug that reported false messages; slightly increases staking performance; optimize staker parameters; fix white send button in GUI\r\n* v1.0.2: Various UI fixes, minor gas overflow consensus fix, per-txout exploit fix, testnet mode setup and functioning\r\n* v1.0.1: Fixed network magic bytes and minimum version to ensure the main network does not conflict with the Skynet network\r\n* v1.0: Initial release\r\n\r\nReindex Required When Upgrading from v1.0.1\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhen you first start the Qtum 1.0.2 GUI wallet after using Qtum v1.0.1 it will prompt you that it must reindex the database. This is normal and is a result of switching our internal database format from per-transaction to per-txout. If you use `qtumd -daemon` it will silently fail to start. You need to use `qtumd -daemon -reindex` in this case. \r\n\r\nQtum Documentation and Usage Resources\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nBasic usage resources:\r\n\r\n* [Official Qtum Usage Guide](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/wiki/Qtum-Wallet-Tutorial)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum staking tutorial](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/qtum-staking-tutorial-using-qtum-qt)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum staking tutorial on Raspberry Pi](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/qtum-staking-tutorial-using-qtumd-on-a-raspberry-pi-3)\r\n* [Unofficial guide for keeping your wallet safe](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/encrypting-backing-up-and-restoring-your-qtum-wallet)\r\n* [Block explorer](https://explorer.qtum.org)\r\n* [Unofficial block explorer](https://qtumexplorer.io/)\r\n\r\nDevelopment resources:\r\n\r\n* [Deploying a custom token to Qtum](https://blog.qtum.org/qtum-custom-token-walkthrough-467d725fa27d)\r\n* [Early example faucet contract](http://earlz.net/view/2017/06/30/2144/the-qtum-sparknet-faucet)\r\n* [Unofficial Qtum Hello World tutorial](https://steemit.com/qtum/@cryptominder/quantum-qtum-blockchain-developer-tutorial-hello-world)\r\n\r\nGeneral Info about Qtum:\r\n\r\n* [Mainnet event AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/comments/6zs8t0/official_qtum_ama_thread_starts_at_10pm_beijing/)\r\n* [Qtum's PoS vs CASPER](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/comments/788oa5/qtums_pos_vs_casper_and_the_nothingatstake_problem/)\r\n* [Technical article explaining Qtum's PoS model in depth](http://earlz.net/view/2017/07/27/1904/the-missing-explanation-of-proof-of-stake-version)\r\n* [Unofficial What is Qtum article](https://storeofvalue.github.io/posts/what-is-qtum-without-the-bullshit/)\r\n\r\nQuickstart\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get started with Qtum is to simply download the binaries below. To give a brief breakdown of the different versions available: \r\n\r\n#### Windows\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.4-win64.zip](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.3/qtum-0.14.4-win64.zip) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using Windows.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.4-win64-setup-unsigned.exe](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.3/qtum-0.14.4-win64-setup-unsigned.exe) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using Windows. This includes an installer and will install Qtum system wide.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.4-win32.zip](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.3/qtum-0.14.4-win32.zip) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 machines using Windows. If you have an older Windows computer and don't care about installing Qtum system-wide, \r\n* [qtum-0.14.4-win32-setup-unsigned.exe](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.3/qtum-0.14.4-win32-setup-unsigned.exe) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 machines using Windows. This includes an installer and will install Qtum system wide. If you have an older Windows computer and want to install Qtum then this is for you.\r\n\r\n#### OSX\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.4-osx64.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.3/qtum-0.14.4-osx64.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using OSX. If you use a modern Mac and want development tools, this is what you want; we do not support older 32bit or PowerPC based Macs.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.4-osx-unsigned.dmg](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.3/qtum-0.14.4-osx-unsigned.dmg) - A version of Qtum-Qt built for 64bit x86 machines using OSX in a .DMG installable format. If you use a modern Mac and aren't a developer, this is what you want; we do not support older 32bit or PowerPC based Macs.\r\n\r\n#### Linux\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.4-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.3/qtum-0.14.4-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 PC platforms running Linux. This is probably what you want for older computers running Linux\r\n* [qtum-0.14.4-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.3/qtum-0.14.4-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 PC platforms running Linux. This is probably what you want for any modern PC or server running Linux\r\n* [qtum-0.14.4-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.3/qtum-0.14.4-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz) - A version of qtumd and qtum-cli built for 32bit ARM platforms using Linux. This includes the Raspberry Pi and many of it's clones\r\n* [qtum-0.14.4-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.3/qtum-0.14.4-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of qtumd and qtum-cli built for 64bit ARM platforms using Linux\r\n\r\nBelow in the full list of binaries, there are also versions that include debug symbols. These are useful for developers, but will run slower and are significantly larger to download. \r\n\r\n#### Build Qtum Core\r\n\r\nIf you want to build it from source, it's recommended to follow the specific [\"build\" documentation](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/tree/testnet-2/doc) for your platform. But mostly it boils down to the following:\r\n\r\n1. Clone the qtum source code and cd into `qtum`\r\n\r\n        git clone --recursive https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum.git\r\n        cd qtum\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Build qtum-core:\r\n\r\n    Configure and build the headless qtum binaries as well as the GUI (if Qt is found).\r\n\r\n    You can disable the GUI build by passing `--without-gui` to configure.\r\n\r\n        ./autogen.sh\r\n        ./configure\r\n        make\r\n\r\n3.  It is recommended to build and run the unit tests to ensure everything is working correctly:\r\n\r\n        make check\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you encounter an error like:\r\n\r\n> make[2]: *** No rule to make target \u2018cpp-ethereum/utils/libscrypt/b64.c\u2019, needed by \u2018cpp-ethereum/utils/libscrypt/libbitcoinconsensus_la-b64.lo\u2019.  Stop.\r\n\r\nThen you did not checkout the cpp-ethereum submodule for Qtum. To do that, simply:\r\n\r\n    cd qtum\r\n    git submodule update --init --recursive\r\n\r\nValidate and Reproduce Binaries\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nQtum uses a tool called Gitian to make reproducible builds that can be verified by anyone. Instructions on setting up a Gitian VM and building Qtum are provided [in doc/gitian-building.md](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/blob/master/doc/gitian-building.md)\r\n\r\nCommunity Resources\r\n---------\r\n\r\nMake sure to check out these resources as well for more information and to keep up to date with all the latest news about Qtum. At least 1 developer is always around, so if you're developing on Qtum and need help, we'd love to welcome you to our community.  \r\n\r\n* [/r/Qtum on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/)\r\n* [Qtum Telegram Group](https://t.me/joinchat/D5oBaw29NeOdpw6qqqf2lw)\r\n* [@QtumOfficial on Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/qtumofficial)\r\n* [Qtum on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/QtumOfficial/)\r\n* [Qtum Forum](https://forum.qtum.org/)\r\n* [Qtum.org](https://qtum.org/en/)\r\n\r\n\r\nQtum Smart Contract Limitations\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n* EVM smart contracts can not receive coins from or send coins to any address type other than pay-to-pubkeyhash (starts with Q) addresses. This is due to a limitation in the EVM\r\n* Contracts are not allowed to create contracts with an initial endowment of coins. The contract must first be created, and then be sent coins in a separate transaction. Humans are also not allowed to create contracts with an initial endowment of coins.\r\n* Although all of the infrastructure is present, Qtum Core does not currently parse Solidity event data. You must parse this yourself using either `searchlogs` or `-record-log-opcodes` features.\r\n* It is not possible to send a contract coins without also executing the contract. This is also the case of Ethereum. This was promised in earlier discussions and technically does work, but due to lack of time for testing this feature was disabled. We hope to reenable this feature with release of the x86 virtual machine in 2018.\r\n* In Qtum there can be multiple addresses used to create a proof-of-stake block. However, the EVM can only see the first output using the `coinbase` operation in Solidity (this address is also the one registered for the continuous staker rewards after 500 blocks). \r\n\r\nHash Validation\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\r\nHash: SHA512\r\n\r\nIf you would like to validate that the binaries you download are exactly the same as those provided and built by the Qtum team, then you can compare your binaries to the following sha256sum hashes:\r\n\r\n    48c54cddbdd28d386fe18c7cddc46cfc5d1877775488048d4d7932fd2b666111  qtum-0.14.4-osx-unsigned.dmg\r\n    5b3f3306450037b8cbb7d10b4adbcfa675d889cf6b1ea23df0bd37dac89a374d  qtum-0.14.4-osx-unsigned.tar.gz\r\n    c270743c35ad578aa204670ec12a20e85d85d68f950bd302582d16627764e659  qtum-0.14.4-osx64.tar.gz\r\n    0767ef83a677aee4ecc63bcafe90b038fd75d6a0fbf09ebd91cc6c1beb2850a2  src/qtum-0.14.4.tar.gz\r\n    4cfc7af2d8080ddea9f203812d8e7657c221b368d53fc5afdbc9d082db103c64  qtum-osx-0.14-res.yml\r\n\r\n    6e16b09f1564d75e653297b0034b84098f1c5c00ba49ab3be26aabfacbd018aa  qtum-0.14.4-aarch64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\n    39acc0c9e422f55a0e830a84167522868edc2179036075f6dcaa0b0850d9c16f  qtum-0.14.4-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\n    19edd1a5e3a239f210c5f4d1373de90aea86a6e9b6a4ec2b14e0f7c67a0df9bc  qtum-0.14.4-arm-linux-gnueabihf-debug.tar.gz\r\n    fa0c212b2d883cf75a1337c8c5a457a42791442c0dc5d94bbaffec2951897247  qtum-0.14.4-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz\r\n    3f67d2c5a02c98224ffa53c374ba31c5135cecb92c32ff29b2552eff525e7008  qtum-0.14.4-i686-pc-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\n    6d30d803a767ce37d426336353d75fe643694fcd29b320cd15a958dff3a4d32a  qtum-0.14.4-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\n    eb2468fc5421ca855d87070f70b67ec7a84894a43c9ddd57dae2feea941e7957  qtum-0.14.4-x86_64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\n    e394c256aa2674249f20c089a788d7ff4c9f686b39ea0b51f3dcf0456f949a7a  qtum-0.14.4-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\n    0767ef83a677aee4ecc63bcafe90b038fd75d6a0fbf09ebd91cc6c1beb2850a2  src/qtum-0.14.4.tar.gz\r\n    391918756fb4e04269c8bc3d3570e16bdc2eb4c4e8a7cf8c49d3509d3fad5b5e  qtum-linux-0.14-res.yml\r\n\r\n    79187553ee15aeedb6996edf7b27d4572cc76ce345c1c885939731bc2e38c009  qtum-0.14.4-win-unsigned.tar.gz\r\n    d96fc6cc7a335dd4b4c24af304f93b0b2677cc1b45a00804bcd752f6886c0b34  qtum-0.14.4-win32-debug.zip\r\n    ba5dd68eba70b665ad115641051f3da86c1bceb1ba94f76a45885c25d20aca2f  qtum-0.14.4-win32-setup-unsigned.exe\r\n    7da28419dfa8944e24bf0b8ed6053df6a320516ea8982e3af714ff37fe448860  qtum-0.14.4-win32.zip\r\n    bcc1d805758624251d24f35c382918f3ba7c3f2b4e38fca16414a42a9c81a777  qtum-0.14.4-win64-debug.zip\r\n    f867cec706d2f6ac8ff1e1e5047e4b19a245c90d501b779de2727b2806e022fc  qtum-0.14.4-win64-setup-unsigned.exe\r\n    efcfd2c7ffe61fb657c2aaa2a54d6bf5c9cd96a1318349cb2225e5a6c48d3409  qtum-0.14.4-win64.zip\r\n    f6888b883e02679363fbdeb5248f1cd1af5ded347f3f408171cc50bf5815ac6b  src/qtum-0.14.4.tar.gz\r\n    5792df3a3e8f183d9b9b04f71f1015a83abf6563276f806a7ad7f6c897919acf  qtum-win-0.14-res.yml\r\n\r\nIn addition, as of the time of this writing there is 0 false positives on the Windows 32bit and 64bit zip files, and 1 false positive on the Windows 32bit and 64bit installer files:\r\n\r\n    installer win32: https://www.virustotal.com/#/file-analysis/OWZhY2Y1OTk5MDk2MmZhMjZlZTFhMGZiMDljZmViZGY6MTUwODg1Nzk4OQ== 1 false positive that we've reported to Rising AV\r\n\r\n    installer win64 https://www.virustotal.com/#/file-analysis/NzFkNWEwY2EwMGVkNDc1ODJhMWViMjFhNWRjZWU3ZTQ6MTUwODg1ODEzMQ== 1 false positive (same as win32)\r\n\r\n    zip win32 https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/7da28419dfa8944e24bf0b8ed6053df6a320516ea8982e3af714ff37fe448860/detection 0 false positives\r\n\r\n    zip win64 https://www.virustotal.com/#/file-analysis/MGE1ZDU5MjQ4ZmM5NjI2NGNjMzNmYWY3NjIyZjk5YWQ6MTUwODg1ODE0Ng== 0 false positives\r\n\r\nYou can validate this message is from Earlz at https://keybase.io/verify\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: Keybase OpenPGP v2.0.76\r\nComment: https://keybase.io/crypto\r\n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\r\nLJYxm6pJzUAnF/qrV7XP\r\n=g54m\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n```\r\n",

                "name": "Mainnet Ignition v1.0.2",
                "description": "Qtum is a decentralized blockchain project built on Bitcoin's UTXO model, with support for Ethereum Virtual Machine based smart contracts, and secured by a proof of stake consensus model. It achieves this through the revolutionary Account Abstraction Layer which allows the EVM to communicate with Qtum's Bitcoin-like UTXO blockchain. For more general information about Qtum as well as links to join our community, go to https://qtum.org\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Qtum Ignition Main Network. This is the main network where the tokens hold value and should be guarded very carefully. There will be a testnet setup soon for developers, in the meantime you can use `-regtest` mode for testing needs. We will announce details about the token swap from QTUM ERC20 coins to QTUM mainnet tokens soon, watch our [website](https://qtum.org) for details about that.  \r\n\r\nThe major features implemented in Qtum Ignition include:\r\n\r\n1. The Ethereum Virtual Machine, which allows for compatibility with most existing Solidity based smart contracts.\r\n2. The Smart Staking Protocol is complete, which is an optimized Proof of Stake implementation designed for a smart contract platform (however, smart contracts can not participate in staking yet).\r\n3. An early and basic smart contract GUI has been implemented that can be used for creating contracts, sending data and Qtum to them, and checking their status by executing them locally. This functionality is similar to Mist's UI right now, but it is still an early version. We will be working on this more to improve it. \r\n4. Regtest mode, which is ideal for developers who wish to create their own private blockchain. It is tuned specifically to make development easier. It will stake blocks automatically every 30 seconds, and can generate proof-of-work blocks instantly as needed.\r\n5. The Decentralized Governance Protocol is completely implemented and functional, which allows certain network parameters to be modified without a fork.\r\n\r\nFor more technical information for how to start developing with Qtum please read the [Guide](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/blob/master/doc/sparknet-guide.md) and also see this tutorial for deploying a simple [faucet smart contract](http://earlz.net/view/2017/06/30/2144/the-qtum-sparknet-faucet) (it hasn't yet been updated for Mainnet for obvious reasons, but all the instructions are the same and you can try them in regtest mode)\r\n\r\nNote: Qtum Core is considered beta software. We make no warranties or guarantees of its security or stability.\r\n\r\nReindex Required When Upgrading from v1.0.1\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhen you first start the Qtum 1.0.2 GUI wallet after using Qtum v1.0.1 it will prompt you that it must reindex the database. This is normal and is a result of switching our internal database format from per-transaction to per-txout. If you use `qtumd -daemon` it will silently fail to start. You need to use `qtumd -daemon -reindex` in this case. \r\n\r\nDeleting the Sparknet and Skynet blockchain\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you downloaded the Sparknet or Skynet wallet and ran it at some point, then most likely you have a copy of the Sparknet or Skynet blockchain on your computer. There is no value in keeping this and it is safe to delete. You simply need to delete the data directory you chose when you first ran Qtum. If you're not sure, then it is probably in the default location. This location depends on platform:\r\n\r\n* On Linux: `~/.qtum`\r\n* On OSX: `~/Library/Application Support/Qtum`\r\n* On Windows: `%APPDATA%\\Qtum` (copy and paste this into your Explorer address bar and it'll take you there)\r\n\r\nIf you get an error about \"unknown genesis block\" or something similar, then this is the problem and you need to delete the old blockchain. Make sure to not delete the file `wallet.dat` if you have any mainnet Qtum tokens stored in an address within it. (It's recommended to keep it and then resync and make sure your coins are safe, just in case)\r\n\r\nQuickstart\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get started with Qtum is to simply download the binaries below. To give a brief breakdown of the different versions available: \r\n\r\n#### Windows\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.3-win64.zip](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.2/qtum-0.14.3-win64.zip) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using Windows.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.3-win64-setup-unsigned.exe](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.2/qtum-0.14.3-win64-setup-unsigned.exe) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using Windows. This includes an installer and will install Qtum system wide.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.3-win32.zip](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.2/qtum-0.14.3-win32.zip) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 machines using Windows. If you have an older Windows computer and don't care about installing Qtum system-wide, \r\n* [qtum-0.14.3-win32-setup-unsigned.exe](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.2/qtum-0.14.3-win32-setup-unsigned.exe) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 machines using Windows. This includes an installer and will install Qtum system wide. If you have an older Windows computer and want to install Qtum then this is for you.\r\n\r\n#### OSX\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.3-osx64.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.2/qtum-0.14.3-osx64.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 machines using OSX. If you use a modern Mac and want development tools, this is what you want; we do not support older 32bit or PowerPC based Macs.\r\n* [qtum-0.14.3-osx-unsigned.dmg](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.2/qtum-0.14.3-osx-unsigned.dmg) - A version of Qtum-Qt built for 64bit x86 machines using OSX in a .DMG installable format. If you use a modern Mac and aren't a developer, this is what you want; we do not support older 32bit or PowerPC based Macs.\r\n\r\n#### Linux\r\n\r\n* [qtum-0.14.3-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.2/qtum-0.14.3-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 32bit x86 PC platforms running Linux. This is probably what you want for older computers running Linux\r\n* [qtum-0.14.3-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.2/qtum-0.14.3-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of Qtum-Qt, qtumd, and qtum-cli built for 64bit x86 PC platforms running Linux. This is probably what you want for any modern PC or server running Linux\r\n* [qtum-0.14.3-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.2/qtum-0.14.3-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz) - A version of qtumd and qtum-cli built for 32bit ARM platforms using Linux. This includes the Raspberry Pi and many of it's clones\r\n* [qtum-0.14.3-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/download/mainnet-ignition-v1.0.2/qtum-0.14.3-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz) - A version of qtumd and qtum-cli built for 64bit ARM platforms using Linux\r\n\r\nBelow in the full list of binaries, there are also versions that include debug symbols. These are useful for developers, but will run slower and are significantly larger to download. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Build Qtum Core\r\n\r\nIf you want to build it from source, it's recommended to follow the specific [\"build\" documentation](https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/tree/testnet-2/doc) for your platform. But mostly it boils down to the following:\r\n\r\n1. Clone the qtum source code and cd into `qtum`\r\n\r\n        git clone --recursive https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum.git\r\n        cd qtum\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Build qtum-core:\r\n\r\n    Configure and build the headless qtum binaries as well as the GUI (if Qt is found).\r\n\r\n    You can disable the GUI build by passing `--without-gui` to configure.\r\n\r\n        ./autogen.sh\r\n        ./configure\r\n        make\r\n\r\n3.  It is recommended to build and run the unit tests to ensure everything is working correctly:\r\n\r\n        make check\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you encounter an error like:\r\n\r\n> make[2]: *** No rule to make target \u2018cpp-ethereum/utils/libscrypt/b64.c\u2019, needed by \u2018cpp-ethereum/utils/libscrypt/libbitcoinconsensus_la-b64.lo\u2019.  Stop.\r\n\r\nThen you did not checkout the cpp-ethereum submodule for Qtum. To do that, simply:\r\n\r\n    cd qtum\r\n    git submodule update --init --recursive\r\n\r\n\r\nResources\r\n---------\r\n\r\nMake sure to check out these resources as well for more information and to keep up to date with all the latest news about Qtum. At least 1 developer is always around, so if you're developing on Qtum and need help, we'd love to welcome you to our community.  \r\n\r\n* [/r/Qtum on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Qtum/)\r\n* [Qtum.org](https://qtum.org/en/)\r\n* [@QtumOfficial on Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/qtumofficial)\r\n* [Qtum on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/QtumOfficial/)\r\n* [Qtum Forum](https://forum.qtum.org/)\r\n* [Block explorer](https://qtum.info)\r\n\r\nQtum Smart Contract Limitations\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n* EVM smart contracts can not receive coins from or send coins to any address type other than pay-to-pubkeyhash (starts with Q) addresses. This is due to a limitation in the EVM\r\n* Contracts are not allowed to create contracts with an initial endowment of coins. The contract must first be created, and then be sent coins in a separate transaction. Humans are also not allowed to create contracts with an initial endowment of coins.\r\n* Although all of the infrastructure is present, Qtum Core does not currently parse Solidity event data. You must parse this yourself using either `searchlogs` or `-record-log-opcodes` features.\r\n* It is not possible to send a contract coins without also executing the contract. This is also the case of Ethereum. This was promised in earlier discussions and technically does work, but due to lack of time for testing this feature was disabled. We hope to reenable this feature with release of the x86 virtual machine in 2018.\r\n* In Qtum there can be multiple addresses used to create a proof-of-stake block. However, the EVM can only see the first output using the `coinbase` operation in Solidity (this address is also the one registered for the continuous staker rewards after 500 blocks). \r\n\r\nUpdate History\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n* v1.0.2: Various UI fixes, minor gas overflow consensus fix, per-txout exploit fix, testnet mode setup and functioning\r\n* v1.0.1: Fixed network magic bytes and minimum version to ensure the main network does not conflict with the Skynet network\r\n* v1.0: Initial release\r\n\r\nHash Validation\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\r\nHash: SHA512\r\n\r\nIf you would like to validate that the binaries you download are exactly the same as those provided and built by the Qtum team, then you can compare your binaries to the following sha256sum hashes:\r\n\r\n    257656794419a0f91d31de7e322d0ac8ff345a75e3e264878b1a91a7e0be8313  qtum-0.14.3-osx64.tar.gz\r\n    83f4b5fbbfe43d20efbc7a51ab3a532d9cb007f31ae14cb8e3b266d172ab0b16  qtum-0.14.3-osx-unsigned.dmg\r\n    8cf2631aafbd87e2ef545093bfbcd643152a14da02e6a2bb3af9cf7ddc634418  qtum-0.14.3-osx-unsigned.tar.gz\r\n\r\n    f942119fc035ae0a563914709e032d5b5c4048f0d2e95dda8bc02f5aab1f1cb1  qtum-0.14.3-aarch64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\n    f61f8e203552be4f549fc38df283be1dd9d29c14d807f3faa5ffd762ceeaf2a1  qtum-0.14.3-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\n    54d13b9b966b60af6b979454243a64f8fb1afb3cbb8de838e3375ad7226c68ab  qtum-0.14.3-arm-linux-gnueabihf-debug.tar.gz\r\n    50c93c64753a4629cc84a6cf29a1484a03de25a6f87fb2df4418dc4abe017766  qtum-0.14.3-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz\r\n    9f7d6b5df606317416850f03441772d725447e38c59456f9540c70c393722506  qtum-0.14.3-i686-pc-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\n    e034ad57685d59fac70ba928f8474077a7766ed3d373098eb652cefe00f3b0d2  qtum-0.14.3-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\n    3d17900bc99efafd07225326ba92e498824fd811d68fb882e42dcb97549c8117  qtum-0.14.3-x86_64-linux-gnu-debug.tar.gz\r\n    822861abae8370dc4909e47a8bcc9d1e375c20ee7295f3a21e931cc4600ec83c  qtum-0.14.3-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz\r\n\r\n    08bf6f557e28166f45ad9f76e132bede665900023e9010b5d1b3701d619082df  qtum-0.14.3-win32-debug.zip\r\n    34f59604c4e0015dc394fe0dd1f0ae7542f2d5887c90ae8021497e84d5c7adc4  qtum-0.14.3-win32-setup-unsigned.exe\r\n    32a8be283f84ef5c6e0febdcd09e06d71728eebfb1f30daa93984e847e65b02b  qtum-0.14.3-win32.zip\r\n    f7683deaca00783cccc1ad59f2567f2f8cccca7b9bda5bee2f1748aa11034880  qtum-0.14.3-win64-debug.zip\r\n    736cfc1c7c72a0aa895877bce78dac32dd53441ef9c78a6da6019af80a65bc4b  qtum-0.14.3-win64.zip\r\n    d7f5887c25734d8246a73b9190f4b469b8b28234d5343472d9754c32c0bc4b32  qtum-0.14.3-win64-setup-unsigned.exe\r\n\r\nYou can validate this message is from Earlz at https://keybase.io/verify\r\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: Keybase OpenPGP v2.0.76\r\nComment: https://keybase.io/crypto\r\n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\r\nfqzEFc5jI15plCQ89h4R\r\n=jUL/\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n```\r\n",

                "name": "Official Release v2.0.0",
                "description": "## Reddcoin Core 2.0.0\n\nVersion 2.0.0 is the official release version of Reddcoin Core. On top of the new features, **this update contains very important security fixes and all users MUST upgrade to this version as soon as possible**. Details on several vulnerabilities were made public by the Bitcoin team [(Official Bitcoin warning)](http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2015-June/009135.html) regarding the issues. It is particularly important that users who are staking do upgrade, as once BIP 66 is enforced, **version 3 blocks will be rejected from the network entirely**.\n\nReddcoin 2.0.0 is a complete rebuild based off Bitcoin 0.9. This means in terms of the code-base we introduced all the changes up to Bitcoin 0.9.5 into this version of Reddcoin Core.\n\nWe have also included a couple of features from the 0.10 build including a connected peers tab and bandwidth monitoring\n\nWe therefore suggest to read the release notes of Bitcoin up to and including 0.9.\n\nv2.0.0 is a recommended update for all users.\n\n### Notable changes\n\nFor further explanation of these, see the above mentioned Bitcoin release notes.\n\n#### Code-base switched to Bitcoin\n\nIn efforts to improve the fast adoption of upstream changes, Reddcoin was switched from using litecoin to bitcoin code base.\n\n#### New utility applications\n\nReddcoin-cli for RPC command line functionality. Moving to split the client and server components from reddcoind\n\n#### Faster synchronization\n\nReddcoin Core 2.0.0 includes parallel block synchronization to greatly reduce the initial blockchain synchronization time.\n\n#### Strict signature encoding (BIP66)\n\nThis release activates BIP66 which enforces strict rules about how transaction signatures are encoded and therefore will introduce a new block version (4). These rules will only activate once a certain number of blocks are mined with this new version. It will take effect after 85% of the network (6120/7200 blocks) are generating v4 blocks (7200 blocks is equivilant to 5 days worth of blocks).\n\nNOTE: This is not a hard fork, as all existing wallets will accept version 4 blocks, although they'll fail to enforce the new requirements.\n\n#### Staking\n\nOnce the above rule is activated, the network will reject the creation of version (3) blocks (stakes on earlier clients e.g v1.4.1). Transactions using earlier clients will be accepted by the network\n\n#### RPC access changes\n\nRPC access now supports binary network addresses. This means that you can specify a single IP address, a CIDR network address or a netmask for accessing the RPC service. Please note, wildcard string matching no longer works and will display an error in the debug.log file when you attempt to use use a wildcard string in the rpcallowip= variable, either as a config setting or launch parameter.\n\n| Before | After |\n| --- | --- |\n| rpcallowip=10.0.0.1 | rpcallowip=10.0.0.1 |\n| rpcallowip=10.0.0.* | rpcallowip=10.0.0.0/24 |\n| rpcallowip=10.0.* | rpcallowip=10.0.0.0/16 |\n| rpcallowip=* | rpcallowip=::/0 |\n| rpcallowip=192.168.1.* | rpcallowip=192.168.1.1/255.255.255.0 |\n\nNote: IPv6 addresses can also be used.\n\n#### Stakeminer will wait for both the blockchain and network\n\nThis release will allow the staking of wallets that are not encrypted. Previously, if a wallet was not encrypted, the wallet would attempt to stake blocks as they were being downloaded. The wallet will now wait before staking is enabled.\n\nIt is however highly recommended to encrypt your wallet for your own peace of mind.\n\n#### QT Debug window includes network and peer details\n\nAn addition to the QT wallet is the network graph tab to visually monitor network usage and the peers details tab to display other attached nodes.\n\n#### DNS Seeds added\n\nAdditional dns seeds (dnsseed.redd.ink/testnet-dnsseed.redd.ink) for main and testnet to create some resilience for the network discovery\n\n#### General comments\n\nPlease backup your wallet regularly and especially before performing this upgrade. Do not copy your wallet.dat while Reddcoin Core is open. Instead you should either use the backup feature you find in the \"File\" menu or shut down Reddcoin Core completely before you make a copy of your wallet.dat.\n\n#### SHA256\n\nc349881b9ea4496cac3f348647317d1b585306fbdfff57bb4fa2687cf0148bfb *reddcoin-2.0.0.0-linux.tar.gz\nf34eb8f1929d0b10d400834cf89e2db417060e5e7437e20e3557fda685614f9c *reddcoin-2.0.0.0-osx-signed.dmg\n547c647fc61772288f282dda021861dc11b902b780915f4cb7ccb4878f260808 *reddcoin-2.0.0.0-win.zip\ne515ff56e675c3d60b4203feedb387a1a906a0171977ed25c5294cf4563f4a22 *reddcoin-2.0.0-win32-setup.exe\ne2e15bc05d3460a6f1d1132db492540318dd343136ceb3e89986eae8edd1fa3c *reddcoin-2.0.0-win64-setup.exe\ndfce44c9ae1d6a6cd3a7f1ac8f0730a427b7b2162f94f2bac177cb027c5628c8 *bootstrap.dat.xz\n",

                "description": "**Escrow**\r\n`rippled` 0.60.0 release includes **Escrow**, (previously called **SusPay**), which introduces a new ledger node type and several new transaction types to the Ripple network. Escrow permits users to cryptographically escrow XRP on RCL with an expiration date using a crypto-condition called preimage-sha-256, commonly referred to as a hashlock. An XRP Escrow transaction on RCL can be used together with Interledger, to allow a payment to be routed without having to trust third-party intermediaries. We believe this will open a range of possibilities and use cases for XRP, particularly when sending high value, low volume payments cross-border.\r\n\r\n**Payment Channels**\r\nThe amendment for Payment Channels was originally introduced in version 0.33.0, but is now ready for Payment Channels to be enabled on the production Ripple Consensus Ledger. XRP Payment Channels are intended for high volume, low value payments. They provide a method for scalable, intermittent, off-ledger settlement flowing in a single direction. For bidirectional payment channels, an XRP Payment Channel can be used in each direction. The recipient can claim any unpaid balance at any time before the channel closes. The owner can top off the channel as needed and must wait out a delay to close the channel to give the recipient a chance to supply any claims. The total amount paid increases monotonically as newer claims are issued.\r\n\r\n**Dynamic UNL Lite**\r\nAt the core of RCL is the consensus process. Through the consensus process, validating nodes agree on a specific subset of the candidate transactions to be considered for the next ledger. Consensus is an iterative process in which nodes relay proposals, or sets of candidate transactions. Nodes communicate and update proposals until a supermajority of peers agree on the same set of candidate transactions.\r\n\r\nDuring consensus, each node evaluates proposals from a specific set of peers, called chosen validators. Chosen validators represent a subset of the network which, when taken collectively, is \u201ctrusted\u201d not to collude in an attempt to defraud the node evaluating the proposals. This definition of \u201ctrust\u201d does not require that each individual chosen validator is trusted. Rather, validators are chosen based on the expectation they will not collude in a coordinated effort to falsify data relayed to the network.\r\n\r\nThe `rippled` 0.60.0 release introduces new Dynamic UNL configuration options, which allow `rippled` to update its set of trusted validators without reconfiguring and restarting. Instead of specifying a static list of trusted validators in the config or validators file, you can configure a trusted publisher key and a URI where the publisher serves signed lists of validators. `rippled` will regularly query the configured URIs for the latest recommended list of validators from the trusted publishers. Configuring the validation quorum is no longer required, as rippled will automatically update its quorum based on its current trusted validator set.\r\n\r\nDynamic UNL Lite is a progressive step towards fully automated dynamic UNLs, to which each client of the Ripple network determines its UNL through policies, rather than trusting a pre-provided list of validators.\r\n\r\n**fix1368 Amendment**\r\n`rippled` 0.60.0 also introduces the *fix1368* Amendment to fix a minor bug in transaction processing that causes some payments to fail when they should be valid. Specifically, during payment processing, some payment steps that are expected to produce a certain amount of currency may produce a microscopically different amount, due to a loss of precision related to floating-point number representation. When this occurs, those payments fail because they cannot deliver the exact amount intended. The fix1368 amendment corrects transaction processing so payments can no longer fail in this manner.\r\nThese features underline Ripple\u2019s continued support to improving RCL by making it more stable, distributed and scalable for settlement of global payments.\r\n\r\n## Upcoming Features\r\nWe do not have an update on the previously announced changes to the hash tree structure that rippled uses to represent a ledger, called SHAMapV2. At the time of activation, this amendment will require brief scheduled allowable unavailability while the changes to the hash tree structure are computed by the network. We will keep the community updated as we progress towards this date (TBA).\r\n\r\nYou can [update to the new version](https://ripple.com/build/rippled-setup/#updating-rippled) on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 or CentOS 7 using yum. For other platforms, please [compile the new version from source](https://wiki.ripple.com/Rippled_build_instructions).\r\n\r\n## 0.60.0 Change Log\r\n- Add `Escrow` support [(#2039)](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/2039)](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/2039)\r\n- Dynamize trusted validator list and quorum [(#1842)](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/1842)\r\n- Simplify fee handling during transaction submission [(#1992)](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/1992)\r\n- Publish server stream when fee changes [(#2016)](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/2016)\r\n- Replace manifest with validator token [(#1975)](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/1975)\r\n- Add validator key revocations [(#2019)](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/2019)\r\n- Add `SecretKey` comparison operator [(#2004)](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/2004)\r\n- Reduce `LEDGER_MIN_CONSENSUS` [(#2013)](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/2013)\r\n- Update `libsecp256k1` and `Beast B30` [(#1983)](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/1983)\r\n- Make `Config` extensible via lambda [(#1993)](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/1993)\r\n- WebSocket permessage-deflate integration [(#1995)](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/1995)\r\n- Do not close socket on a foreign thread [(#2014)](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/2014)\r\n- Update build scripts to support latest boost and ubuntu distros [(#1997)](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/1997)\r\n- Handle protoc targets in scons ninja build [(#2022)](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/2022)\r\n- Specify syntax version for ripple.proto file [(#2007)](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/2007)\r\n- Eliminate protocol header dependency [(#1962)](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/1962)\r\n- Use gnu gold or clang lld linkers if available [(#2031)](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/2031)\r\n- Add tests for `lookupLedger` [(#1989)](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/1989)\r\n- Add unit test for `get_counts` RPC method [(#2011)](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/2011)\r\n- Add test for `transaction_entry` request [(#2017)](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/2017)\r\n- Unit tests of RPC `sign` [(#2010)](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/2010)\r\n- Add failure only unit test reporter [(#2018)](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/2018)\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n- Enforce rippling constraints during payments [(#2049)](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/2049)\r\n- Fix limiting step re-execute bug [(#1936)](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/1936)\r\n- Make `wss` work the same as `wss2` [(#2033)](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/2033)\r\n- Check for malformed public key on payment channel [(#2027)](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/2027)\r\n- Config test uses unique directories for each test [(#1984)](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/1984)\r\n- Send a websocket ping before timing out in server [(#2035)](https://github.com/ripple/rippled/pull/2035)\r\n",

                "description": "This release is the culmination of nearly five months of steady work, with contributions from 19 developers. For this release, we primarily focused on improving the stability and performance of the renter. To achieve this, @DavidVorick and our new employee @ChrisSchinnerl designed and implemented a new [write-ahead log package](https://github.com/NebulousLabs/writeaheadlog), which @lukechampine leveraged to create a new on-disk format for file contracts. This allows contracts to be updated efficiently while maintaining ACID properties, like a database. @DavidVorick also reworked much of the upload code, resulting in more throughput and more reliable file repairs. And as always, we made tons of bug fixes and performance improvements throughout the code base, affecting nearly every file in the project.\r\n\r\nImportantly, this release contains a fix for the new difficulty algorithm that was introduced in v1.3.0. This fix is a hardfork that activates at block 139,000, which is expected to occur in late January, 2018. So before celebrating the new year, please ensure that you have upgraded your nodes to v1.3.1!\r\n\r\nSupplying your wallet password and API password (if you use one) is now easier, thanks to contributions by @petabytestorage and @ericflo, respectively. If you set the `SIA_WALLET_PASSWORD` and `SIA_API_PASSWORD` environment variables, `siad` and `siac` will automatically use them. Previously, these passwords had to be supplied via an interactive prompt, which made certain operations annoying to automate.\r\n\r\nWe had so many contributors to this release that I can't list everything they did.

Of course, our returning contributors also submitted some great PRs to this release: @vevarm, @S-anasol, @petabytestorage, @eddiewang, @starius, and @mtlynch.

                "description": "This is a minor release that introduces a number of long-awaited features.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent features are remote file repair and wallet lookahead. Remote file repair allows Sia to automatically repair your files even after the original file data has been deleted from your machine. It works by downloading data from hosts, expanding it to the desired redundancy, and reuploading the redundant pieces to other hosts. This is a crucial feature for Sia because hosts that go offline or fail to meet quality requirements must be replaced. Note that in order for remote file repair to work, the file must report at least 1x redundancy.\r\n\r\nWallet lookahead means that the wallet will pre-generate the next *n* addresses for its seed, and watch the blockchain for them. (Remember, each address corresponds to a particular seed index.) For example, even if the user has only created 5 addresses from their seed, the wallet may internally be keeping track of the next 100 addresses. This functionality is mainly useful for people who use the same seed on multiple computers: before this fix, their wallet balance could be reported incorrectly, which caused some (understandable) anxiety.\r\n\r\nv1.3.0 also contains a number of additions to our API:\r\n\r\n- A `/wallet/changepassword` route, allowing users to change their wallet password\r\n- Upgraded `/wallet/sendsiacoins` to allow sending one output to multiple recipients (primarily useful for exchanges)\r\n- New `/tpool` endpoints for getting raw transaction data and transaction fee estimations\r\n- A `/host/estimatescore` endpoint for estimating your host's score, as seen by renters\r\n\r\nWe have also switched our gateway multiplexer from muxado to smux, which should improve stability and performance, and modified the gateway connection protocol to require fewer roundtrips while sending more actionable information.\r\n\r\nFinally, there were many internal bug fixes and optimizations, including transaction pool speed-ups, fixes for the renter stalling, and faster initial blockchain download. One of the fixes that I'll appreciate most is converting [this horrible-looking stack dump](https://github.com/NebulousLabs/Sia/issues/1745) to a simple and obvious \"out of disk space\" error.\r\n\r\nWe'd like to thank the huge number of contributors to this release. The quality of contributions has increased dramatically over the past few months, and it has made life a lot easier for the core devs. Please let me know if I missed anyone:\r\n\r\n- @rnabel worked with @johnathanhowell to implement remote file repair\r\n- @ChrisSchinnerl worked with @lukechampine to implement wallet lookahead, among other fixes\r\n- @GlenDC worked with @lukechampine to implement the muxado->smux transition and gateway protocol changes\r\n- @starius worked with @DavidVorick  to improve initial blockchain download speed\r\n- @elopio contributed packaging metadata for a Sia `snap` package\r\n- @aiorla made good use of a new JSON type in Go 1.8\r\n- @jnmclarty, @mharkus, @mtlynch, @petabytestorage, @rudibs, @S-anasol, and @skynode fixed up a bunch of documentation\r\n- @moimael added some flags to our release packaging to reduce the size of Sia binaries\r\n\r\nContributors have also helped keep the issue tracker under control by answering common questions and marking duplicates. This is part of an ongoing effort to rein in our issue tracker, which we plan to start pruning more aggressively in the coming weeks.",

The host's storage backend has been completely rewritten to improve performance and scalability. Admin privileges are also no longer required to be a host on Windows. The wallet has (finally!) moved to an on-disk database, meaning that it will unlock instantly after the database is synced to the blockchain. The wallet also now supports creating a new wallet from an existing seed, and \"sweeping\" the coins in an existing seed into another wallet. Finally, addressing a frequent need of new users, the wallet can be recreated with a new seed, meaning users no longer have to manually delete their `wallet` folder.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** Upgrading an existing host can take quite a long time. Please be patient. Similarly, the first time you unlock the new wallet, it will take a long time because it's initializing the database. This only needs to occur once.\r\n\r\nThis release marks a huge uptick in the number of contributors to Sia! :tada:\r\nThe following people contributed to v1.2.0:\r\n\r\n- @RNabel added bash completions for `siac` and a command that lists contract details. Power users will definitely appreciate this!\r\n- @GlenDC documented the gateway RPC protocol and started tackling numerous gateway issues. Look out for him in the next release!\r\n- @VoidingWarranties fixed a gateway bug. Couldn't stay away, huh? :)\r\n- @S-anasol cleaned up some host code.\r\n- @poiuty updated our Go dependency in the readme.\r\n\r\nIf you want to contribute to Sia, drop by our Slack.

The hostdb is smarter about scanning and ranking hosts, and you can see more in-depth output using the `siac hostdb -v` command.\r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Unfortunately, our upgrades to the Renter require a full rescan of the blockchain. As a result, if you are upgrading from an older version, `siad` may take a long time to load the first time you run it. On an HDD, this may take up to an hour. On an SSD it should take closer to 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nYou should be able to upgrade to v1.1.1 by running `siac update`.

The new wallet will regularly consolidate small outputs into one larger output.\n\nThanks to the new renter algorithm designed by @DavidVorick, we are seeing upload/download speeds that saturate most residential connections!

This is a complete rewrite and fixes many\r\n  of the old wallet issues.\r\n- New wallet has preliminary support for OTC functionality\r\n- Create `webrpc.Client` for JSON-2.0 RPC calls.\r\n- Add this CHANGELOG.md file.\r\n- Add Installation.md file, with install instructions for go.\r\n- Timelock distribution addresses. The first 25% of the distribution is\r\n  spendable. After that 25% is spent, a timestamp will be added to the code to\r\n  enable further distribution.\r\n- Add `/coinSupply` endpoint. Correctly returns total, locked and unlocked coin\r\n  amounts.\r\n- `testutil` package for common test setup methods.\r\n- `/version` endpoint, which will return the current node version number and\r\n  the HEAD commit id when build the node\r\n- `-no-ping-log` option to disable ping/pong log output\r\n- Check for invalid block signatures during startup and recreate the database\r\n  if they are corrupted.\r\n- Add methods for converting fixed-point decimal strings to droplets and\r\n  vice versa.\r\n- Add `make run`, `make test`, `make lint`, `make check` to `Makefile`\r\n\r\n### Changed\r\n\r\n- Flag peers as incoming or outgoing.\r\n- Refactor to decouple `wallet` and `visor` package.\r\n- Refactor `cli` package for use as a library.\r\n- `README` improvements.\r\n- Set default wallet's label as \"Your Wallet\"\r\n- Use BIP32 mnemomic seeds by default in `address_gen`.\r\n- Add `-x` option to `address_gen`, to generate a random base64-encoded 128-bit\r\n  seed instead of a BIP32 mnemomic seed.\r\n- Add `-v` option to `address_gen` to print all address information\r\n  (pubkey, seckey, address, seed) to stdout as JSON.\r\n- All API and CLI methods with \"coin\"-related arguments must be a string and\r\n  can use decimal notation to specify coin amounts.\r\n- CLI's `walletHistory` command prints amounts as fixed-point decimal strings.\r\n  Previously, it printed amounts as integers representing whole skycoin amounts,\r\n  and did not support droplets / fractional skycoins.\r\n- A user is prevented from broadcasting a new transaction with unspent outputs\r\n  that they have already sent as an unconfirmed transaction.\r\n\r\n### Deprecated\r\n\r\n- `/api/getEffectiveOutputs` is deprecated in favor of `/coinSupply`.\r\n\r\n### Removed\r\n\r\n- Old wallet\r\n- `/api/create-address` endpoint (use the `address_gen` tool)\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n\r\n- Wallet folder path loading.\r\n- #371 Fix `/wallet/spend`, will return only when pending transaction is\r\n  confirmed.\r\n- #443 Fix predicted balance in `/wallet/spend` API call.\r\n- #444 Fix bug in `/blockchain/progress` API call.\r\n- Removed globals in `gui` package that caused race condition with wallet API\r\n  calls.\r\n- #494 Clean invalid unconfirmed transactions during startup.\r\n- Various race conditions around the bolt.DB blockchain DB\r\n- Missing `strand()` call in `daemon.Visor.AnnounceTxns`.\r\n",

See [building.md](https://github.com/steemit/steem/blob/master/doc/building.md) for platform specific instructions. Additionally, CMake 3.2 is required (up from 2.8.12).\r\n\r\n### Smooth Bandwidth Algorithm\r\n\r\nThere were two big problems with the bandwidth algorithm. The first was an integer overflow that caused `max_virtual_bandwidth` to be calculated incorrectly. The second was a programmed behavior that caused bandwidth requirements to increase too rapidly for a small increase in traffic. We have implemented a new algorithm for how to calculate global bandwidth requirements that still protects the blockchain under extreme circumstances, but is less aggressive during small deviations from past behavior. Overall, this should improve the user experience when it comes to bandwidth rate limiting. #1257\r\n\r\n### Check Memos\r\n\r\nTransfers with the sender's private key information will be rejected with a soft fork. The error message recommends the sender change their keys in such an event. The CLI wallet does a similar check against the sender's keys and the keys in the wallet. #1181 \r\n\r\n### Fix Delegations in Account by Key Plugin\r\n\r\nThe Account by Key plugin now recognizes and tracks accounts that were created with delegation. The problem showed in the CLI wallet when accounts created with delegation could not be found by public key. #1194\r\n\r\n### HF19 Cleanup\r\n\r\nThere were a number of temporary fields and objects that existed to help transition the blockchain through HF 19. Because those values are cryptographically locked in to the blockchain, we have replaced the temporary fields with constants. #1193 \r\n\r\n### Account History Filter\r\n\r\nThe Account History plugin now supports filtering ops with a mutually exclusive whitelist or blacklist. The config options are `history-whitelist-ops` and `history-blacklist-ops` respectively. #301\r\n\r\n### Block Production Virtual Op\r\n\r\nBlock production now emits a virtual operation that is trackable in account history. #832 \r\n\r\n### Ignore 0% Interest Virtual Op\r\n\r\nInterest virtual operations are now only emitted if there is a non-zero interest payment #1222\r\n\r\n### Out of Memory Error Messages\r\n\r\nWhen the free space on the memory mapped state file is less than 100 MB, an error message will be displayed every 10 blocks warning of the impending doom and current free space available. #1223 \r\n\r\n### Log Expiring Transactions\r\n\r\nWhen transactions expire from the pending state, they will now be logged at the debug level #1215 \r\n\r\n### Increase p2p Cache Time\r\n\r\nIncreased the p2p cache time from 15 to 60 seconds #1242\r\n\r\n### Update get_transaction Disable Message\r\n\r\nOn Steemit production nodes, we are not supporting the index to return transactions by ID. Previously, `get_transaction` failed silently by not returning a transaction. The call now returns an error message explaining that the API is disabled. #1213\r\n\r\n### Remove Unused APIs\r\n\r\nThe following API calls were not in a usable state and we have no plans on supporting them, so they have been removed. `set_subscribe_callback` `set_pending_transaction_callback` `cancel_all_subscriptions` #1197",

The original proposal can be read on [steemit.com](https://steemitdev.com/steemit/@steemitblog/proposing-steem-equality-0-19-0-as-the-next-fork).\r\n\r\n### Linear Rewards\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of a linear reward curve everyone will have a say directly proportional to their stake. #1051 \r\n\r\n### Square Root Curation Rewards Curve \r\n\r\nThis is to offset the changes in rewards due to the linear reward curve. Curation rewards should stay roughly where they are. #1052\r\n\r\n### Increase Vote Impact\r\n\r\nEach vote's impact has been increased by 4x. #1053\r\n\r\n### Witness Price Feeds Properly Expires\r\n\r\nFixed a bug that prevented price feeds from expiring. #882\r\n\r\n### Historical Posts Cannot Be Deleted\r\n\r\nOnce a post has existed for 7 days, it can no longer be deleted. #876\r\n\r\n### Cancelling a Steem Power Delegation Fixed\r\n\r\nFixed a bug that prevented cancelling a delegation in some circumstances #971\r\n\r\n### Deleting Post Condition Part of Consensus\r\n\r\nPreviously, requiring a post had 0 rshares before deletion was enforced via a soft fork. Now it is part of consensus #977\r\n\r\n### `account_create_operation` Fixed\r\n\r\nThere was a bug in the `account_create_operation`. Our short term fix was to temporarily disable the operation. It has been fixed and is re-enabled. #987\r\n\r\n### Fixed 0 Delegation Objects\r\n\r\nPreviously, creating an account with 100% STEEM would create a 0 delegation object. This has been fixed. #997\r\n\r\n### Optimized Full Node Reindex\r\n\r\nAddressed several changes to increase full node reindex speed. #1160 #1161 #1162\r\n\r\n### New Follow Plugin Option\r\n\r\nWhen starting the follow plugin you can specify an epoch time to start calculating user feeds `--follow-start-feeds`. Default is 0 to always calculate feeds.\r\n\r\n### Increased p2p Stability\r\n\r\nFixed an issue that was causing instability in the p2p network when live and when syncing.\r\n\r\n### Disable `get_block` at Runtime\r\n\r\nWith `--disable-get-block` you can disable `get_block` and `get_block_header` in the database API at runtime.",

Ubuntu 14.04 is not compatible out of the box. Ubuntue 16.04 has all the required versions. Build instructions have been updated to reflect this change. We continue to recommend using one of our pre-built Docker images which works on all supported versions of Ubuntu and most modern operating systems. #980\r\n\r\n- The Steem license has been updated to MIT. https://steemit.com/steemit/@steemitblog/steemd-is-now-completely-free-to-use-with-an-mit-license #1055\r\n\r\n- The built in NTP client has been completely removed. All block producers must use `ntpd` to keep in sync with the network. #816\r\n\r\n- All soft forking logic has been moved out of chain and into the witness plugin. #894\r\n\r\n- Account bandwidth is now handled by the witness plugin. #894\r\n\r\n- The witness plugin now has a custom operation called `enable_content_editing_operation` that allows a user to signal they want to edit their content. By consensus, content is editable indefinitely, but is soft forked to be frozen after payout. This operation requires an active key and is designed to prevent vandalism if a posting key is compromised. #1017 \r\n\r\n- `steemd` can run without having any plugins enabled by specifying `enabled_plugins = ` in the config. #1021\r\n\r\n- impacted.cpp has been updated to correctly reflect what accounts are impacted. This will cause a retroactive reordering some account history upon reindex. #931\r\n\r\n- The escrow commands in the wallet were implemented but were never reflected and thus inaccessible. The cli wallet can now issue escrow commands. #920\r\n\r\n- The database_api call, `get_block` now returns the block ID, public signing key, and a list of transaction IDs like the cli wallet does. #187\r\n\r\n- Fixed a bug in the ordering of `fixed_string` that resulting in some queries returning incomplete results. #951\r\n\r\n- Fixed a bug in the account history plugin when specifying a range of accounts to track that resulted in accounts not being tracked that should have been #862\r\n\r\n- The field children_rshares_2 is not needed by consensus and has been removed. #1027\r\n\r\n- The category object is not needed by consensus. The behavior was usurped by the tags plugin a long time ago. It has been removed. This removed the following API calls `get_trending_categories` (`get_trending_tags` should have identical functionality), `get_best_categories`, `get_active_categories`, and `get_recent_categories`. #1032\r\n\r\n- Additional assertions have been added to chainbase to fail safely when attempting to access an index that does not exist. #1024\r\n\r\n- Improved the error message when an account runs out of bandwidth #1080\r\n\r\n- Hardcoded reward_fund values from HF17 to remove need to recalculate them on reindex #1018\r\n\r\n- Added extra locking to application.cpp to prevent race conditions. #1035\r\n\r\n- Optimized evaluators by removing a redundant variable. #1023\r\n\r\n- Removed unused sandbox directory, 'chain2' #1056\r\n\r\n- Config constant `GRAPHENE_CURRENT_DB_VERSION` was not being used and has been deleted. #896 ",

                "description": "## Iguana Desktop 0.1.5.1e beta release\r\n\r\n### NOTE: This is experimental release.\r\n\r\nThis release version starts a series of quick experimental ninja releases. You'll get updated releases with new updates very quite often. You can skip them if you wish. or wait for the Non-Experimental release version and install them when available.\r\n\r\nThis version of wallet includes many performance improvement features for GUI and Iguana Core.\r\nThe GUI for Full Mode and Basilisk Mode from the last release to this release is an almost 7th iteration of itself, improving on its previous dev builds.\r\n\r\nThis build took a lot of dev time solving Basilisk Mode issues and improving its performance.\r\n\r\nNOTE: There are still known issues with Basilisk Mode. Please read Known Issues for workarounds to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Native Komodo Support\r\nKomodo Native Mode works out of the box for OS X. (You must have zcashparams installed)\r\n\r\nFor Linux users, it is recommended to compile komodo binaries from source code and replace it in Iguana App.\r\nKomodo Github repository: https://github.com/jl777/komodo\r\n\r\nThis Iguana release includes Native Komodo binaries for Windows as well, but the GUI is not linked to it yet. The GUI need some upgrade to support Native Mode for Komodo. Its support will be pushed in next release.\r\n\r\n## Assetchains and PAX\r\nThis is a quick experimental release. Only a few Assetchains and PAX USD chain are available for testing in this version.\r\nNext version will support all supported Assetchains and PAX chains.\r\n\r\n#### Support for REVS added along with multiple addresses support for Full and Basilisk Wallets\r\n- You can now check your REVS balances and transactions in your wallet by activating it in Basilisk Mode.\r\n- Can also importprivkey of your BTCD address via `settings > Import Keys` and then logout, and login back again to check your REVS balance.\r\n- If it doesn't show your balance, can try refreshing latest data for wallet from REVS coins `dashboard > Basilisk Actions > Fetch Wallet Data`.\r\n\r\n## BTC Basilisk support disabled for this version\r\nDue to backend core API changes, BTC Basilisk Mode support is disabled for this version for all platforms.\r\nIt'll also be enabled back in next version.\r\n\r\n## New feature: Jumblr\r\nThis version includes Jumblr DAPP GUI.\r\nYou can read more about its usage and instructions here:\r\nhttps://github.com/SuperNETorg/komodo/wiki/How-to-use-Jumblr-DAPP-in-Iguana-Desktop-App\r\n\r\n\r\n### Known Issues\r\n- Basilisk Mode transactions may fail to send or error. The workaround is to push \"Refresh Funds\" button before sending the transaction.\r\n- Wait for a minute while Refresh Funds is updating the data cache for Basilisk Wallet.\r\n- Or just use Full Mode wallet.\r\n- Or Native Mode Wallet for available coin/KMD, if available for your platform.\r\n\r\n## Installation Instructions\r\nInstallers for this release version are not pushed. Installer builds need some troubleshooting pending. Will have the installers builds out soon. If not for this release then expect them for next release version.\r\n\r\nFor this version, extract/unzip the files and run the **Iguana** binary to start.\r\n\r\nOS X users can replace the existing Iguana.app file in /Applications.\r\n\r\nLinux users can just run from the extracted files/directory or just replace the files inside /opt/ with the extracted one to upgrade.\r\n\r\n#### Windows build of this experimental release is a bit delayed.\r\n\r\n```\r\nIguanaApp-0.1.5.1e-beta-osx.app.zip\r\n1a68074ffc9bcfbbfef3006bdc071be7955f145ea2590e6d7189c07d29b628ae\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Virus Total result of\r\nIguanaApp-0.1.5.1e-beta-osx.app.zip](https://virustotal.com/en/file/1a68074ffc9bcfbbfef3006bdc071be7955f145ea2590e6d7189c07d29b628ae/analysis/1488742303/)\r\n\r\n```\r\nIguanaApp-0.1.5.1e-beta-linux-x64.tar.gz\r\n66e0494d33ed17aa6a9a13cfb3e975fbb34749aa68b064e79b48e703a73348c0\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Virus Total result of\r\nIguanaApp-0.1.5.1e-beta-linux-x64.tar.gz](https://virustotal.com/en/file/66e0494d33ed17aa6a9a13cfb3e975fbb34749aa68b064e79b48e703a73348c0/analysis/1488742291/)",

Disable Generate new Address in EDEX Wallets. - DONE\n8. Delete Add Coin option from EDEX Wallets menus. - DONE\n9. Move Add Coin drop down options on top of Mode select buttons. - DONE\n10. Add More coin select options in login add coin dialog. - DONE\n11. Instead of showing some random text, show Coming soon in EasyDEX Menu page. - DONE\n12.

Maybe remove the search option as there is no need for now and maybe a background colour to the menu bar. - DONE\n16. At the top \"My KMD address (maybe should be changed to Komodo as that is the name of the coin) but have a copy to clip board option. - DONE\n17. have a copy to clip board option for main address of wallet. - DONE\n\nOther Features added:\n - Basilisk Mode is special, and it has it\u2019s own needs to register and validate address over the network before the wallet could talk to Notary Nodes and get required data. For troubleshooting, these buttons were needed. So spent a bit of time and added these for Basilisk Mode wallet screens only.\n- Clicking on \u2018Get Notary Nodes List\u2019 takes the user directly to Atomic Explorer and auto selects the required options and submits the query to display the result.\n- Validate button make sure the address of wallet is added to Notary Nodes network. In technical terms, it is imported as watch only address in notary nodes.\n- Register does importaddress as watch only on notary nodes.\n\n- Atomic Explorer Integration activated:\nFull Mode and Basilisk Mode Wallet coins, both now seamlessly point to Atomic Explorer inside EasyDEX-GUI.\nClicking on Transaction history\u2019s blue button at the right-hand side will take you to the Atomic Explorer page and will show you that particular transactions\u2019s Full detail in your local Atomic Explorer.\nNo need to go to third-party online Explorers.\nAs we move to further releases, I\u2019ll make this Atomic Explorer beautified, and it will feel as good as online explorers. For now, it\u2019s more like JSON data displayed in the page. Useful for developers for troubleshooting purposes.\n\n- Sending transaction also now shows executed transactions' details on the same page. The transaction ID generated is linked to Atomic Explorer and takes you straight to Atomic Explorer when clicked.\n```\n\n## NOTE FOR EXISTING BETA TESTERS\n\nPlease uninstall your Windows and Linux wallet from your system before installing this beta.\n\n### Linux users can follow these instructions to uninstall:\n\n``` shell\n#Open terminal\ncd /opt/IguanaApp/\n\n#Login as super user or with root previlages\nsudo su\n\n#Execute Uninstall command\n./Uninstall-Iguana\n\n#And follow the uninstallation wizard.\n```\n\n### Windows users can find uninstaller from start menu or just go to add/remove programms of your windows version and remove Iguana software.\n\nOnce you have uninstalled existing Iguana Wallet, then install this new beta as usual.\n\n## NOTE for Linux Users:\n\nLinux Installer is bundled with `komodod` daemon which is tested to work with ONLY Ubuntu 16.04 64bit.\nIf you are using any other flavor of Linux, you will have to compile and copy the compiled `komodod` to `/opt/IguanaApp/resources/app/linux64/` and then start Iguana Desktop to use Komodo in Native Mode.\n\n### Linux Install Instructions\n- Download Linux .run file\n- Make sure it has executable permissions with `chmod +x IguanaApp-0.1.2-beta-test-linux-x64-installer.run` to file\n- To start install wizard execute .run file with `sudo ./IguanaApp-0.1.2-beta-test-linux-x64-installer.run`\n- Follow installation wizard and finish the installation.\n- Can double-click Desktop shortcut to start wallet.\n- To _Uninstall Iguana Desktop_ login as super user in terminal and go to `/opt/IguanaApp/`\n- and execute uninstall script from there with `./Uninstall-Iguana`\n\n``` shell\nIguanaApp-0.1.3-beta-linux-x64-installer.run\nab05a0e0ab55b4812857dc53084cc3b8dfe1b9e378349a87a2dead5618b24a41\n```\n\n[Virus Total result of IguanaApp-0.1.3-beta-linux-x64-installer.run](https://virustotal.com/en/file/ab05a0e0ab55b4812857dc53084cc3b8dfe1b9e378349a87a2dead5618b24a41/analysis/1485854408/)\n\n``` shell\nIguanaApp-0.1.3-beta-windows-installer.exe\n9599ba1baec8ff35c14172632d3bf05231a5d5bb163e77839dee8944f53357b7\n```\n\n[Virus Total result of IguanaApp-0.1.3-beta-windows-installer.exe](https://virustotal.com/en/file/9599ba1baec8ff35c14172632d3bf05231a5d5bb163e77839dee8944f53357b7/analysis/1485854413/)\n\n``` shell\nIguanaApp-0.1.3-beta-osx-installer.app.zip\n5df225ed62e38da485c27b270e9859d6ec2e6c002b59fc670eaad1c6c75e7db6\n```\n\n[Virus Total result of IguanaApp-0.1.3-beta-osx-installer.app.zip](https://virustotal.com/en/file/5df225ed62e38da485c27b270e9859d6ec2e6c002b59fc670eaad1c6c75e7db6/analysis/1485948126/)\n",

We have coded up a new solution called the Flux Difficulty Algorithm.  This is a minor adjustment to Digishield so that it implements throttling which will eliminate the peaks and troughs of the difficulty chart.  This works by making an extra comparison with the previous block time and throttling the rate of change.  The current Ethereum difficulty algorithm works using the approach of looking at the time of the previous block.\n\nWe have been testing this for a few days in our local Testnet and the results look good.

This issue did not show up in our earlier Testnet testing as this issue does not show up for smaller hash rates.\n\nSince we are a new network, we felt it was right to make the necessary changes to address this issue early on.  The network is working fine but we can do better.\n\nThe technical details are that we will increase the number of past blocks that we will sample for calculations (up from 30 minutes) and we will decrease the % adjustment.\n\nWe have been testing this for a few days in our local Testnet and the results look good.

Over the release candidate the only change in this version are some additional DNS seeds. \r\n\r\nAs always, remember to **backup your wallet** before upgrading. \r\n\r\nParticularly interesting/fun in this release are the inclusion of the new `vtc1` prefixed pay-to-witness-pubkey-hash (p2wpkh) bech32 addresses which will become the default in the future. You can generate these from the debug window console (Help -> Debug Window -> Console) by using the `addwitnessaddress` command with a p2pkh address from your wallet. e.g. `addwitnessaddress VqC5JZZbiuVM5eZ7rcyMeBD3GnJebveeGX false` -> `vtc1q564855umf73meq4l8svzwdrgeu2lgyrha09pvh`. 0.12.0 wallets and the LN wallet [Lit](https://github.com/mit-dci/lit) can send to this type of address as normal. You can also generate a backwards compatible p2wpkh address using `addwitnessaddress VqC5JZZbiuVM5eZ7rcyMeBD3GnJebveeGX` -> `3N5SQsujvwWh3DVjVJpU9bfy22W9UGCkYw`. This is the same type of \"segwit address\" that the Ledger app generates and is embedded inside a pay-to-script-hash (p2sh) address. \r\n\r\nBackend developers should be aware that this version contains non-backwards-compatible changes to the RPC interface. Developers should ensure compliance with the changes before deploying this upgrade in production systems.\r\n\r\nI have included signatures for each of the binaries, signed with my [pgp key](http://keyserver.ubuntu.com:11371/pks/lookup?op=vindex&fingerprint=on&search=0x04E9BCFB4E777CA3).

To see a major list of changes, check the change logs from Bitcoin Core 0.13.2 (which v0.11 was based on) to 0.15.1.\r\n\r\nThis version of Vertcoin Core requires a new version of P2Pool to work that can be found on this branch: https://github.com/vertcoin/p2pool-vtc/commits/vardiff\r\n\r\nAs always, be sure to **back up your wallet.dat** _before_ running this new version, just in case.\r\n\r\nThis update contains no forks, so upgrading is optional.",

This update is in response to two large unknown miners blocking SegWit activation on the Vertcoin network (https://vtconline.org/sf.html) despite >95% of nodes being upgraded and a clear desire from the community to upgrade. \r\n\r\nSince over 50% of the network hashrate belongs to the \"attackers\", they will likely not update and not implement UASF, so this update should be treated in the same way as a Hard Fork. Old wallets will continue to follow whichever chain has the most work, and will only reorg to the SegWit chain once it has more work behind it. Thus, any fork will be temporary, but will likely exist for some time. Therefore, *everyone* should upgrade to this new wallet to ensure the stability of the network and reduce the risk of a fork.",

Thus, it soft forks BIP34, 66, 65, CSV and SegWit into Vertcoin as well as the other BIPs included in Bitcoin Core since v0.8. The soft forks will start signalling compliance from block 675,360 and will continue to signal for a year. Once 75% of blocks over a 2016 block period have signalled, after another 2016 block period the soft forks will activate and old version blocks will be orphaned from that point on. **Therefore it is highly recommended you upgrade your wallet and this update should be treated as mandatory.** It is especially important that pools upgrade as we need at least 75% of blocks mined to be upgraded in order to activate the soft forks. Pools that do not upgrade could risk orphaned blocks after activation. Everyone else, including users and exchanges, should upgrade too to guard against forking after activation. \n\n**Remember to backup your wallet.dat before you upgrade your wallet. Failing to do so could result in the loss of all your coins.**\n\nMiners themselves will not have to do anything, but pool operators will need to upgrade their pool software to be compatible with the new wallet. We have a version of stratum-mining that is confirmed working. An upgraded p2pool version is in development and should be released soon.\n\nstratum-mining: https://github.com/Crypto-Expert/stratum-mining\n\nDevelopment Fund Donation Address: VpBsRnN749jYHE9hT8dZreznHfmFMdE1yG\n",

For details and configuring instructions, please refer to the next section\r\n* `waves.blockchain.max-transactions-per-block-diff` - Max transactions per block diff, affects size of atomic persistence, default value is 1000\r\n* `waves.blockchain.min-blocks-in-memory` - Amount of blocks in memory. Fast rollback is possible up to this value, default value is 100\r\n* `waves.network.traffic-logger.ignore-tx-messages` lists codes of incoming message types which should not be logged, defaults to 23 (Block) and 25 (Transaction)\r\n* `waves.network.traffic-logger.ignore-rx-messages` lists codes of incoming message types which should not be logged, defaults to 25 (Transaction)\r\n* `waves.blockchain.store-transactions-in-state` - allows to switch transactions storage in state, default value \"on\"\r\n* `waves.blockchain.in-memory-chunk-size` sets the size of in-memory blocks window, the smaller value reduces the memory footprint, default value is 5\r\n* `waves.blockchain.in-mem-chunks-amount` sets the number of in-memory windows, default value is 10, the fast rollback is possible up to \r\n  `in-memory-chunk-size * in-mem-chunks-amount blocks`\r\n* `waves.matcher.order-cleanup-interval` sets the lean-up interval for expired orders on matcher, default value is 5m\r\n* `waves.matcher.rest-order-limit` limits amount of orders exposed via API, default value is 100\r\n* `waves.mvstore-page-split-size` allows changing the size of MVStore in-memory pages, default value 4096 bytes\r\n* `waves.network.synchronization.invalid-block-storage` section controls invalid block cache. If a block which has been loaded from a remote peer can not \r\n  be appended to the blockchain, validation error is cached, so that no blocks with such signature are loaded from other peers. This helps improve sync process. `max-size` limits invalid block cache size and `timeout` limits invalid block cache residency time.\r\n* `waves.utx.cleanup-interval` defines an interval for utx to re-validate all transactions, default value is 5 min\r\n### New Mainnet peer list\r\nIf you have installed your node from DEB package, please update your `waves.conf` file to include the latest list of Waves Official Mainnet nodes:\r\n```\r\nwaves.network.known-peers = [\r\n      \"13.228.86.201:6868\"\r\n      \"13.229.0.149:6868\"\r\n      \"18.195.170.147:6868\"\r\n      \"34.253.153.4:6868\"\r\n      \"35.156.19.4:6868\"\r\n      \"52.50.69.247:6868\"\r\n      \"52.52.46.76:6868\"\r\n      \"52.57.147.71:6868\"\r\n      \"52.214.55.18:6868\"\r\n      \"54.176.190.226:6868\"\r\n    ]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Logging\r\n\r\nWe now separate what gets logged to files and what can be seen in STDOUT.\r\nBy default, node logs with `INFO` level to STDOUT and `DEBUG` in log file, which can be found at `/var/log/waves` if starting through `systemd` or `upstart`. Log-files are rotated, compressed, those older that 30 days are deleted, max size of all log files is 1Gb.\r\n\r\nIf you run a node with a JAR, you can easily change levels/output dir.\r\n\r\n* To change STDOOUT level, start the node with\r\n `-Dlogback.stdout.level=TRACE`\r\n* To change file log output level, start the node with\r\n  `-Dlogback.file.level=TRACE`\r\n* To change file log output directory, start the node with\r\n `-Dlogback.file.directory=/another/directory`\r\n\r\n## System requirements\r\nWe recommend to set `-Xmx` parameter to `4G` in case of transaction storage turned on, and `2G` if you switched off transactions storage. With NG protocol activation, expect your node to consume significantly more disk space. Disabling transaction storage will reduce disk usage. However, if you need to retrieve transaction data via API, you'll need to keep transaction storage enabled.",

Our new low memory prover reduces memory usage by 43% when generating a shielded transaction, from 3 GB to 1.7 GB. An experimental feature, payment disclosure, can help services better manage their shielded payments.  We also now fully support the ``z_shieldcoinbase`` RPC call to help miners sweep up and shield their coinbase rewards.\r\n\r\nSummary of the changes included in this release:\r\n\r\n1. Auto-senescence cycle has been reduced from 18 to 16 weeks. (#2733)\r\n2. Low-memory prover reduces JoinSplit creation memory usage from 3 GB to 1.7GB. (#2670, [stats](https://speed.z.cash/timeline/?exe=1&base=1%2B178&ben=memory+createjoinsplit&env=1&revs=50&equid=off&quarts=on&extr=on))\r\n3. Payment disclosure has been added as an experimental feature with new RPC calls ``z_getpaymentdisclosure`` and ``z_validatepaymentdisclosure`` (#2519). This feature enables a sender to prove that a payment was made to a recipient, which can help services better manage their shielded payments. See [the documentation](https://github.com/zcash/zcash/blob/master/doc/payment-disclosure.md) for a full explanation of this new feature.\r\n4. ``z_shieldcoinbase`` is now a fully supported RPC call (#2692). See an explanation of this command [here](https://github.com/zcash/zcash/tree/master/doc/shield-coinbase.md).\r\n5. Libsnark has been brought into the source repository tree. (#2652)\r\n6. Fixed potential shutdown errors have been fixed. (#2555)\r\n7. User interface messages have been cleaned up. (#2548, #2150, #2649)\r\n8. The extended QA tests have been migrated to Zcash. (#2533)\r\n9. A workaround has been implemented in the test ``wallet_protectcoinbase``, which was previously failing on some platforms. (#2698)\r\n10. Benchmarking has been updated with new performance measurements and fixes.

We fixed build issues encountered when using GCC 7. (#2545)\r\n4. We added support for fetching the public network parameters from IPFS.

We changed `z_sendmany` to fail with an error if the user sets `minconf=0` when sending from z-addresses. (#2525, #2526)\r\n3. We extended the `listunspent` RPC method to specify whether outputs were from a coinbase transaction, to help users identify t-addresses that need to have their contents shielded. (#2522)\r\n4.

We improved the privacy of transactions created by our wallet that pay from shielded addresses to transparent addresses. The new version conceals more information about shielded note values in chained JoinSplit transactions. (#2440)\r\n2. We improved reindexing and block download performance by switching to `libsecp256k1` for transparent signature validation.

We added a config parameter to reject transactions from the mempool by number of transparent inputs.

Fixes bug where tx spending only notes had priority of 0.\n- Closes #1901. Increase default settings for the max block size when\n  mining and the amount of space available for priority transactions.\n- Write witness caches when writing the best block\n  For steady-state operation, this reduces the average time between wallet disk\n  writes from once per block to once per hour.\n  On -rescan, witness caches are only written out at the end along with the best\n  block, increasing speed while ensuring that on-disk state is kept consistent.\n  Witness caches are now never recreated during a -reindex, on the assumption that\n  the blocks themselves are not changing (the chain is just being reconstructed),\n  and so the witnesses will remain valid.\n  Part of #1749.\n- Add porter dev overrides for CC, CXX, MAKE, BUILD, HOST\n- Apply miniupnpc patches to enable compilation on Solaris 11\n  These can be removed after the next MiniUPnP release.\n  Closes #1835.\n- Closes #1903. Add fee parameter to z_sendmany.\n- Add an upstream miniupnpc patch revision\n- Metrics - Don't exclaim unless > 1\n  \"You have validated 0 transactions!\" sounds a little less enthusiastic that intended. Also, only says \"1 transaction\".\n- Address review comments, tweak strings\n- bash-completion: Adapt for 0.12 and 0.13\n- separate completion for bitcoind and bitcoin-cli\n- remove RPC support from bitcoind completion\n- add completion for bitcoin-tx and bitcoin-qt\n- rely on autoloading of completions\n- Change function names to not clash with Bitcoin, apply to correct binaries\n- Add bash completion files to Debian package\n- Always bash-complete the default account\n- Add Zcash RPC commands to CLI argument completion\n- Fixes #1823. Witness anchors for input notes no longer cross block boundaries.\n- Edit for grammar: \"block chain\"\n  At this point, I believe it is universally accepted that \"blockchain\" is one word, and should not be separated into two.\n- Increase timeout as laptops on battery power have cpu throttling.\n- Isolate verification to a `ProofVerifier` context object that allows verification behavior to be tuned by the caller.\n- Regression test.\n- Ensure cache contains valid entry when anchor is popped.\n- Ensure ProofVerifier cannot be accidentally copied.\n- Document behaviour of CWallet::SetBestChain\n- WitnessAnchorData only needs to store one witness per JSOutPoint.\n- Rename Dummy to Disabled.\n- Add more tests for ProofVerifier.\n- Fix indentation\n- Generate JS for trydecryptnotes, make number of addresses a variable\n- Add JS to second block to ensure witnesses are incremented\n- ASSERT_TRUE -> ASSERT_FALSE\n- Skip JoinSplit verification before the last checkpoint\n  Part of #1749\n- Gather release notes from previous release to HEAD\n  Also update release-process.md to replace git shortlog command with\n  release-notes.py script.\n- Add a reindex test that fails because of a bug in decrementing witness caches\n  Ref: zcash#1904 (comment)\n- Make the test pass by fixing the bug!\n- Only check cache validity for witnesses being incremented or decremented\n  Fixes the bug resulting from #1904.\n- Check that E' points are actually in G2 by ensuring they are of order r.\n- Fix bug in wallet tests\n- Extract block-generation wallet test code into a function\n- Rewrite reindex test to check beyond the max witness cache size\n- Fix bug in IncrementNoteWitness()\n- Update payment API docs to recommend -rescan for fixing witness errors\n- Update version to 1.0.4\n- Update man pages\n- Release notes, authors, changelog\n- Update seed nodes\n- Bugfix #14 - getblocksubsidy RPC command is incorrect\n",

You should update as soon as possible if you are using a previous release. This release only partially mitigates against transaction replay attacks until the ZenCash network passes Block 117,575. It is recommended NOT to attempt to reclaim ZEN balances from ZCL wallet files and if possible to refrain from moving around ZEN until we pass Block 117,575. After the Soft Fork activates these wallets will be safe to use to conduct transactions and to reclaim ZEN from ZCL wallet files.\r\n\r\nPlease keep yourself informed about new releases via [Slack](https://slackinvite.zensystem.io/) or our [Blog](https://blog.zensystem.io/) \r\n\r\n```\r\nDebian package (Depends: libc6 (>= 2.17), libgcc1 (>= 1:3.0), libgomp1 (>= 4.9), libstdc++6 (>= 5.2))\r\n\r\nsha256sum f009270e9f18062724ca925d57ccc571e854acfc01856eb3ba6148b28862c9d9  zen-2.0.9-2-b4315d9-amd64.deb\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe MacOS binaries are not signed with an Apple developer certificate.
